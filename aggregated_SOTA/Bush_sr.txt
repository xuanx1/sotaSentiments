1989:
Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, and distinguished Members of the House and Senate,
honored guests, and fellow citizens: Less than 3 weeks ago, I joined you on the
West Front of this very building and, looking over the monuments to our proud
past, offered you my hand in filling the next page of American history with a
story of extended prosperity and continued peace. And tonight I'm back to offer
you my plans as well. The hand remains extended; the sleeves are rolled up;
America is waiting; and now we must produce. Together, we can build a better
America.

It is comforting to return to this historic Chamber. Here, 22 years ago, I first
raised my hand to be sworn into public life. So, tonight I feel as if I'm
returning home to friends. And I intend, in the months and years to come, to
give you what friends deserve: frankness, respect, and my best judgment about
ways to improve America's future. In return, I ask for an honest commitment to
our common mission of progress. If we seize the opportunities on the road before
us, there'll be praise enough for all. The people didn't send us here to bicker,
and it's time to govern.

And many Presidents have come to this Chamber in times of great crisis: war and
depression, loss of national spirit. And 8 years ago, I sat in that very chair
as President Reagan spoke of punishing inflation and devastatingly high interest
rates and people out of work -- American confidence on the wane. And our
challenge is different. We're fortunate -- a much changed landscape lies before
us tonight. So, I don't propose to reverse direction. We're headed the right
way, but we cannot rest. We're a people whose energy and drive have fueled our
rise to greatness. And we're a forward-looking nation -- generous, yes, but
ambitious, not for ourselves but for the world. Complacency is not in our
character -- not before, not now, not ever.

And so, tonight we must take a strong America and make it even better. We must
address some very real problems. We must establish some very clear priorities.
And we must make a very substantial cut in the Federal budget deficit. Some
people find that agenda impossible, but I'm presenting to you tonight a
realistic plan for tackling it. My plan has four broad features: attention to
urgent priorities, investment in the future, an attack on the deficit, and no
new taxes. This budget represents my best judgment of how we can address our
priorities. There are many areas in which we would all like to spend more than I
propose; I understand that. But we cannot until we get our fiscal house in
order.

Next year alone, thanks to economic growth, without any change in the law, the
Federal Government will take in over $80 billion more than it does this year.
That's right -- over $80 billion in new revenues, with no increases in taxes.
And our job is to allocate those new resources wisely. We can afford to increase
spending by a modest amount, but enough to invest in key priorities and still
cut the deficit by almost 40 percent in 1 year. And that will allow us to meet
the targets set forth in the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law. But to do that, we must
recognize that growth above inflation in Federal programs is not preordained,
that not all spending initiatives were designed to be immortal.

I make this pledge tonight: My team and I are ready to work with the Congress,
to form a special leadership group, to negotiate in good faith, to work day and
night -- if that's what it takes -- to meet the budget targets and to produce a
budget on time.

We cannot settle for business as usual. Government by continuing resolution, or
government by crisis, will not do. And I ask the Congress tonight to approve
several measures which will make budgeting more sensible. We could save time and
improve efficiency by enacting 2-year budgets. Forty-three Governors have the
line-item veto. Presidents should have it, too. And at the very least, when a
President proposes to rescind Federal spending, the Congress should be required
to vote on that proposal instead of killing it by inaction. And I ask the
Congress to honor the public's wishes by passing a constitutional amendment to
require a balanced budget. Such an amendment, once phased in, will discipline
both the Congress and the executive branch.

Several principles describe the kind of America I hope to build with your help
in the years ahead. We will not have the luxury of taking the easy, spendthrift
approach to solving problems because higher spending and higher taxes put
economic growth at risk. Economic growth provides jobs and hope. Economic growth
enables us to pay for social programs. Economic growth enhances the security of
the Nation, and low tax rates create economic growth.

I believe in giving Americans greater freedom and greater choice. And I will
work for choice for American families, whether in the housing in which they
live, the schools to which they send their children, or the child care they
select for their young. You see, I believe that we have an obligation to those
in need, but that government should not be the provider of first resort for
things that the private sector can produce better. I believe in a society that
is free from discrimination and bigotry of any kind. And I will work to knock
down the barriers left by past discrimination and to build a more tolerant
society that will stop such barriers from ever being built again.

I believe that family and faith represent the moral compass of the Nation. And
I'll work to make them strong, for as Benjamin Franklin said: "If a sparrow
cannot fall to the ground without His notice, can a great nation rise without
His aid?" And I believe in giving people the power to make their own lives
better through growth and opportunity. And together, let's put power in the
hands of people.

Three weeks ago, we celebrated the bicentennial inaugural, the 200th anniversary
of the first Presidency. And if you look back, one thing is so striking about
the way the Founding Fathers looked at America. They didn't talk about
themselves. They talked about posterity. They talked about the future. And we,
too, must think in terms bigger than ourselves. We must take actions today that
will ensure a better tomorrow. We must extend American leadership in technology,
increase long-term investment, improve our educational system, and boost
productivity. These are the keys to building a better future, and here are some
of my recommendations:

I propose almost $2.2 billion for the National Science Foundation to promote
basic research and keep us on track to double its budget by 1993.

I propose to make permanent the tax credit for research and development.

I've asked Vice President Quayle to chair a new Task Force on Competitiveness.

And I request funding for NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration]
and a strong space program, an increase of almost $2.4 billion over the current
fiscal year. We must have a manned space station; a vigorous, safe space shuttle
program; and more commercial development in space. The space program should
always go "full throttle up." And that's not just our ambition; it's our
destiny.

I propose that we cut the maximum tax rate on capital gains to increase
long-term investment. History on this is clear -- this will increase revenues,
help savings, and create new jobs. We won't be competitive if we leave whole
sectors of America behind. This is the year we should finally enact urban
enterprise zones and bring hope to the inner cities.

But the most important competitiveness program of all is one which improves
education in America. When some of our students actually have trouble locating
America on a map of the world, it is time for us to map a new approach to
education. We must reward excellence and cut through bureaucracy. We must help
schools that need help the most. We must give choice to parents, students,
teachers, and principals; and we must hold all concerned accountable. In
education, we cannot tolerate mediocrity. I want to cut that dropout rate and
make America a more literate nation, because what it really comes down to is
this: The longer our graduation lines are today, the shorter our unemployment
lines will be tomorrow.

So, tonight I'm proposing the following initiatives: the beginning of a $500
million program to reward America's best schools, merit schools; the creation of
special Presidential awards for the best teachers in every State, because
excellence should be rewarded; the establishment of a new program of National
Science Scholars, one each year for every Member of the House and Senate, to
give this generation of students a special incentive to excel in science and
mathematics; the expanded use of magnet schools, which give families and
students greater choice; and a new program to encourage alternative
certification, which will let talented people from all fields teach in our
classrooms. I've said I'd like to be the "Education President." And tonight, I'd
ask you to join me by becoming the "Education Congress."

Just last week, as I settled into this new office, I received a letter from a
mother in Pennsylvania who had been struck by my message in the Inaugural
Address. "Not 12 hours before," she wrote, "my husband and I received word that
our son was addicted to cocaine. He had the world at his feet. Bright, gifted,
personable -- he could have done anything with his life. And now he has chosen
cocaine." "And please," she wrote, "find a way to curb the supply of cocaine.
Get tough with the pushers. Our son needs your help."

My friends, that voice crying out for help could be the voice of your own
neighbor, your own friend, your own son. Over 23 million Americans used illegal
drugs last year, at a staggering cost to our nation's well-being. Let this be
recorded as the time when America rose up and said no to drugs. The scourge of
drugs must be stopped. And I am asking tonight for an increase of almost a
billion dollars in budget outlays to escalate the war against drugs. The war
must be waged on all fronts. Our new drug czar, Bill Bennett, and I will be
shoulder to shoulder in the executive branch leading the charge.

Some money will be used to expand treatment to the poor and to young mothers.
This will offer the helping hand to the many innocent victims of drugs, like the
thousands of babies born addicted or with AIDS because of the mother's
addiction. Some will be used to cut the waiting time for treatment. Some money
will be devoted to those urban schools where the emergency is now the worst. And
much of it will be used to protect our borders, with help from the Coast Guard
and the Customs Service, the Departments of State and Justice, and, yes, the
U.S. military.

I mean to get tough on the drug criminals. And let me be clear: This President
will back up those who put their lives on the line every single day -- our local
police officers. My budget asks for beefed-up prosecution, for a new attack on
organized crime, and for enforcement of tough sentences -- and for the worst
kingpins, that means the death penalty. I also want to make sure that when a
drug dealer is convicted there's a cell waiting for him. And he should not go
free because prisons are too full. And so, let the word go out: If you're caught
and convicted, you will do time.

But for all we do in law enforcement, in interdiction and treatment, we will
never win this war on drugs unless we stop the demand for drugs. So, some of
this increase will be used to educate the young about the dangers of drugs. We
must involve the parents. We must involve the teachers. We must involve the
communities. And, my friends, we must involve ourselves, each and every one of
us in this concern.

One problem related to drug use demands our urgent attention and our continuing
compassion, and that is the terrible tragedy of AIDS. I'm asking for $1.6
billion for education to prevent the disease and for research to find a cure.

If we're to protect our future, we need a new attitude about the environment. We
must protect the air we breathe. I will send to you shortly legislation for a
new, more effective Clean Air Act. It will include a plan to reduce by date
certain the emissions which cause acid rain, because the time for study alone
has passed, and the time for action is now. We must make use of clean coal. My
budget contains full funding, on schedule, for the clean coal technology
agreement that we've made with Canada. We've made that agreement with Canada,
and we intend to honor that agreement. We must not neglect our parks. So, I'm
asking to fund new acquisitions under the Land and Water Conservation Fund. We
must protect our oceans. And I support new penalties against those who would
dump medical waste and other trash into our oceans. The age of the needle on the
beaches must end.

And in some cases, the gulfs and oceans off our shores hold the promise of oil
and gas reserves which can make our nation more secure and less dependent on
foreign oil. And when those with the most promise can be tapped safely, as with
much of the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge, we should proceed. But we must use
caution; we must respect the environment. And so, tonight I'm calling for the
indefinite postponement of three lease sales which have raised troubling
questions, two off the coast of California and one which could threaten the
Everglades in Florida. Action on these three lease sales will await the
conclusion of a special task force set up to measure the potential for
environmental damage.

I'm directing the Attorney General and the Administrator of the Environmental
Protection Agency to use every tool at their disposal to speed and toughen the
enforcement of our laws against toxic-waste dumpers. I want faster cleanups and
tougher enforcement of penalties against polluters.

In addition to caring for our future, we must care for those around us. A decent
society shows compassion for the young, the elderly, the vulnerable, and the
poor. Our first obligation is to the most vulnerable -- infants, poor mothers,
children living in poverty -- and my proposed budget recognizes this. I ask for
full funding of Medicaid, an increase of over $3 billion, and an expansion of
the program to include coverage of pregnant women who are near the poverty line.
I believe we should help working families cope with the burden of child care.
Our help should be aimed at those who need it most: low-income families with
young children. I support a new child care tax credit that will aim our efforts
at exactly those families, without discriminating against mothers who choose to
stay at home.

Now, I know there are competing proposals. But remember this: The overwhelming
majority of all preschool child care is now provided by relatives and neighbors
and churches and community groups. Families who choose these options should
remain eligible for help. Parents should have choice. And for those children who
are unwanted or abused or whose parents are deceased, we should encourage
adoption. I propose to reenact the tax deduction for adoption expenses and to
double it to $3,000. Let's make it easier for these kids to have parents who
love them.

We have a moral contract with our senior citizens. And in this budget, Social
Security is fully funded, including a full cost-of-living adjustment. We must
honor our contract.

We must care about those in the shadow of life, and I, like many Americans, am
deeply troubled by the plight of the homeless. The causes of homelessness are
many; the history is long. But the moral imperative to act is clear. Thanks to
the deep well of generosity in this great land, many organizations already
contribute, but we in government cannot stand on the sidelines. In my budget, I
ask for greater support for emergency food and shelter, for health services and
measures to prevent substance abuse, and for clinics for the mentally ill. And I
propose a new initiative involving the full range of government agencies. We
must confront this national shame.

There's another issue that I've decided to mention here tonight. I've long
believed that the people of Puerto Rico should have the right to determine their
own political future. Personally, I strongly favor statehood. But I urge the
Congress to take the necessary steps to allow the people to decide in a
referendum.

Certain problems, the result of decades of unwise practices, threaten the health
and security of our people. Left unattended, they will only get worse. But we
can act now to put them behind us.

Earlier this week, I announced my support for a plan to restore the financial
and moral integrity of our savings system. I ask Congress to enact our reform
proposals within 45 days. We must not let this situation fester. We owe it to
the savers in this country to solve this problem. Certainly, the savings of
Americans must remain secure. Let me be clear: Insured depositors will continue
to be fully protected, but any plan to refinance the system must be accompanied
by major reform. Our proposals will prevent such a crisis from recurring. The
best answer is to make sure that a mess like this will never happen again. The
majority of thrifts in communities across the Nation have been honest. They've
played a major role in helping families achieve the dream of home ownership. But
make no mistake, those who are corrupt, those who break the law, must be kicked
out of the business; and they should go to jail.

We face a massive task in cleaning up the waste left from decades of
environmental neglect at America's nuclear weapons plants. Clearly, we must
modernize these plants and operate them safely. That's not at issue; our
national security depends on it. But beyond that, we must clean up the old mess
that's been left behind. And I propose in this budget to more than double our
current effort to do so. This will allow us to identify the exact nature of the
various problems so we can clean them up, and clean them up we will.

We've been fortunate during these past 8 years. America is a stronger nation
than it was in 1980. Morale in our Armed Forces has been restored; our resolve
has been shown. Our readiness has been improved, and we are at peace. There can
no longer be any doubt that peace has been made more secure through strength.
And when America is stronger, the world is safer.

Most people don't realize that after the successful restoration of our strength,
the Pentagon budget has actually been reduced in real terms for each of the last
4 years. We cannot tolerate continued real reduction in defense. In light of the
compelling need to reduce the deficit, however, I support a 1-year freeze in the
military budget, something I proposed last fall in my flexible freeze plan. And
this freeze will apply for only 1 year, and after that, increases above
inflation will be required. I will not sacrifice American preparedness, and I
will not compromise American strength.

I should be clear on the conditions attached to my recommendation for the coming
year: The savings must be allocated to those priorities for investing in our
future that I've spoken about tonight. This defense freeze must be a part of a
comprehensive budget agreement which meets the targets spelled out in
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law without raising taxes and which incorporates reforms
in the budget process.

I've directed the National Security Council to review our national security and
defense policies and report back to me within 90 days to ensure that our
capabilities and resources meet our commitments and strategies. I'm also
charging the Department of Defense with the task of developing a plan to improve
the defense procurement process and management of the Pentagon, one which will
fully implement the Packard commission report. Many of these changes can only be
made with the participation of the Congress, and so, I ask for your help. We
need fewer regulations. We need less bureaucracy. We need multiyear procurement
and 2-year budgeting. And frankly -- and don't take this wrong -- we need less
congressional micromanagement of our nation's military policy. I detect a slight
division on that question, but nevertheless -- [laughter].

Securing a more peaceful world is perhaps the most important priority I'd like
to address tonight. You know, we meet at a time of extraordinary hope. Never
before in this century have our values of freedom, democracy, and economic
opportunity been such a powerful and intellectual force around the globe. Never
before has our leadership been so crucial, because while America has its eyes on
the future, the world has its eyes on America.

And it's a time of great change in the world, and especially in the Soviet
Union. Prudence and common sense dictate that we try to understand the full
meaning of the change going on there, review our policies, and then proceed with
caution. But I've personally assured General Secretary Gorbachev that at the
conclusion of such a review we will be ready to move forward. We will not miss
any opportunity to work for peace. The fundamental facts remain that the Soviets
retain a very powerful military machine in the service of objectives which are
still too often in conflict with ours. So, let us take the new openness
seriously, but let's also be realistic. And let's always be strong.

There are some pressing issues we must address. I will vigorously pursue the
Strategic Defense Initiative. The spread, and even use, of sophisticated
weaponry threatens global security as never before. Chemical weapons must be
banned from the face of the Earth, never to be used again. And look, this won't
be easy. Verification -- extraordinarily difficult, but civilization and human
decency demand that we try. And the spread of nuclear weapons must be stopped.
And I'll work to strengthen the hand of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Our diplomacy must work every day against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.

And around the globe, we must continue to be freedom's best friend. And we must
stand firm for self-determination and democracy in Central America, including in
Nicaragua. It is my strongly held conviction that when people are given the
chance they inevitably will choose a free press, freedom of worship, and
certifiably free and fair elections.

We must strengthen the alliance of the industrial democracies, as solid a force
for peace as the world has ever known. And this is an alliance forged by the
power of our ideals, not the pettiness of our differences. So, let's lift our
sights to rise above fighting about beef hormones, to building a better future,
to move from protectionism to progress.

I've asked the Secretary of State to visit Europe next week and to consult with
our allies on the wide range of challenges and opportunities we face together,
including East-West relations. And I look forward to meeting with our NATO
partners in the near future.

And I, too, shall begin a trip shortly to the far reaches of the Pacific Basin,
where the winds of democracy are creating new hope and the power of free markets
is unleashing a new force. When I served as our representative in China 14 or 15
years ago, few would have predicted the scope of the changes we've witnessed
since then. But in preparing for this trip, I was struck by something I came
across from a Chinese writer. He was speaking of his country, decades ago, but
his words speak to each of us in America tonight. "Today," he said, "we're
afraid of the simple words like `goodness' and `mercy' and `kindness."' My
friends, if we're to succeed as a nation, we must rediscover those words.

In just 3 days, we mark the birthday of Abraham Lincoln, the man who saved our
Union and gave new meaning to the word "opportunity." Lincoln once said: "I hold
that while man exists, it is his duty to improve not only his own condition but
to assist in ameliorating that of mankind." It is this broader mission to which
I call all Americans, because the definition of a successful life must include
serving others.

And to the young people of America, who sometimes feel left out, I ask you
tonight to give us the benefit of your talent and energy through a new program
called YES, for Youth Entering Service to America.

To those men and women in business, remember the ultimate end of your work: to
make a better product, to create better lives. I ask you to plan for the longer
term and avoid that temptation of quick and easy paper profits.

To the brave men and women who wear the uniform of the United States of America,
thank you. Your calling is a high one: to be the defenders of freedom and the
guarantors of liberty. And I want you to know that this nation is grateful for
your service.

To the farmers of America, we appreciate the bounty you provide. We will work
with you to open foreign markets to American agricultural products.

And to the parents of America, I ask you to get involved in your child's
schooling. Check on the homework, go to the school, meet the teachers, care
about what is happening there. It's not only your child's future on the line,
it's America's.

To kids in our cities, don't give up hope. Say no to drugs; stay in school. And,
yes, "Keep hope alive."

To those 37 million Americans with some form of disability, you belong in the
economic mainstream. We need your talents in America's work force. Disabled
Americans must become full partners in America's opportunity society.

To the families of America watching tonight in your living rooms, hold fast to
your dreams because ultimately America's future rests in your hands.

And to my friends in this Chamber, I ask your cooperation to keep America
growing while cutting the deficit. That's only fair to those who now have no
vote: the generations to come. Let them look back and say that we had the
foresight to understand that a time of peace and prosperity is not the time to
rest but a time to press forward, a time to invest in the future.

And let all Americans remember that no problem of human making is too great to
be overcome by human ingenuity, human energy, and the untiring hope of the human
spirit. I believe this. I would not have asked to be your President if I didn't.
And tomorrow the debate on the plan I've put forward begins, and I ask the
Congress to come forward with your own proposals. Let's not question each
other's motives. Let's debate, let's negotiate; but let us solve the problem.

Recalling anniversaries may not be my specialty in speeches -- [laughter] -- but
tonight is one of some note. On February 9th, 1941, just 48 years ago tonight,
Sir Winston Churchill took to the airwaves during Britain's hour of peril. He'd
received from President Roosevelt a hand-carried letter quoting Longfellow's
famous poem: "Sail on, O Ship of State! Sail on, O Union, strong and great!
Humanity with all its fears, With all the hopes of future years, Is hanging
breathless on thy fate!" And Churchill responded on this night by radio
broadcast to a nation at war, but he directed his words to Franklin Roosevelt.
"We shall not fail or falter," he said. "We shall not weaken or tire. Give us
the tools, and we will finish the job."

Tonight, almost half a century later, our peril may be less immediate, but the
need for perseverance and clear-sighted fortitude is just as great. Now, as
then, there are those who say it can't be done. There are voices who say that
America's best days have passed, that we're bound by constraints, threatened by
problems, surrounded by troubles which limit our ability to hope. Well, tonight
I remain full of hope. We Americans have only begun on our mission of goodness
and greatness. And to those timid souls, I repeat the plea: "Give us the tools,
and we will do the job."

Thank you. God bless you, and God bless America.

1990:
Tonight, I come not to speak about the "State of the Government", not to
detail every new initiative we plan for the coming year, nor describe every
line in the budget. I'm here to speak to you and to the American people
about the State of the Union about our world, the changes we've seen, the
challenges we face. And what that means for America.

There are singular moments in history, dates that divide all that goes
before from all that comes after. And many of us in this chamber have lived
much of our lives in a world whose fundamental features were defined in
1945. And the events of that year decreed the shape of nations, the pace of
progress, freedom or oppression for millions of people around the world.

Nineteen Forty-Five provided the common frame of reference the compass
points of the postwar era we've relied upon to understand ourselves. And
that was our world until now. The events of the year just ended, the
Revolution of '89, have been a chain reaction, changes so striking that it
marks the beginning of a new era in the world's affairs.

Think back think back just twelve short months ago to the world we knew as
1989 began.

One year, one year ago the people of Panama lived in fear under the thumb
of a dictator. Today democracy is restored. Panama is free.

"Operation Just Cause" has achieved its objective. And the number of
military personel in Panama is now very close to what it was before the
operation began. And tonight I am announcing that before the end of
February the additional numbers of American troops, the brave men and women
of our armed forces who made this mission a success, will be back home.

A year ago in Poland, Lech Walesa declared he was ready to open a dialogue
with the Communist rulers of that country. And today, with the future of a
free Poland in their own hands, members of Solidarity lead the Polish
government.

And a year ago, freedom's playwright, Vaclav Havel, languished as a
prisoner in Prague. And today it's Vaclav Havel, President of
Czechoslovakia.

And one year ago Erich Honecker of East Germany claimed history as his
guide. He predicted the Berlin Wall would last another hundred years. And
today, less than one year later, it's the wall that's history.

Remarkable events, remarkable events, events that fulfill the long-held
hopes of the American people. Events that validate the longstanding goals
of American policy, a policy based upon a single shining principle: the
cause of freedom.

America, not just the nation, but an idea alive in the minds of the people,
everywhere. As this new world takes shape, America stands at the center of
a widening circle of freedom, today, tomorrow and into the next century.

Our nation is the enduring dream of every immigrant who ever set foot on
these shores, and the millions still struggling to be free. This nation,
this idea called America was and always will be a new world, our new
world.

At a workers' rally in a place called Branik on the outskirts of Prague the
idea called America is alive. A worker, dressed in grimy overalls, rises to
speak at the factory gates. And he begins his speech to his fellow citizens
with these words, words of a distant revolution: "We hold these truths to
be self-evident. That all men are created equal, that they are endowed by
their creator with certain unalienable rights, and that among these are
life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness." It's no secret here at home
freedom's door opened long ago. The cornerstones of this free society have
already been set in place: democracy, competition, opportunity, private
investment, stewardship, and of course, leadership.

And our challenge today is to take this democratic system of ours, a system
second to none, and make it better:

A better America where there's a job for whoever wants one;

Where women working outside the home can be confident their children are
in safe and loving care, and where Government works to expand child
alternatives for parents.

Where we reconcile the needs of a clean environment and a strong economy.

Where "Made in the USA" is recognized around the world as the symbol of
quality and progress,

And where every one of us enjoys the same opportunities to live, to work
and to contribute to society. And where, for the first time, the American
mainstream includes all of our disabled citizens.

Where everyone has a roof over his head, and where the homeless get the
help they need to live in dignity.

Where our schools challenge and support our kids and our teachers, and
every one of them makes the grade,

Where every street, every city, every school and every child is drug-free.

And finally, and finally, where no American is forgotten. Our hearts go out
to our hostages, our hostages who are ceaselessly in our minds and in our
efforts. That's part of the future we want to see, the future we can make
for ourselves. But dreams alone won't get us there. We need to extend our
horizon, to commit to the long view. And our mission for the future starts
today.

In the tough competitive markets around the world, America faces the great
challenges and great opportunities. And we know that we can succeed in the
global economic arena of the 90's. But to meet that challenge we must make
some fundamental changes, some crucial investments in ourselves.

Yes, we are going to invest in America. This Administration is determined
to encourage the creation of capital, capital of all kinds. Physical
capital: everything from our farms and factories to our workshops and
production lines, all that is needed to produce and deliver quality goods
and quality services. Intellectual, intellectual capital: the source of
ideas that spark tomorrow's products. And of course human capital: the
talented work force that we'll need to compete in the global market.

And let me tell you, if we ignore human capital, if we lose the spirit of
American ingenuity, the sprit that is the hallmark of the AMERICAN worker,
that would be bad. The American worker is the most productive worker in the
world.

We need to save more. We need to expand the pool of capital for new
investments that mean more jobs and more growth. And that's the idea behind
the new initiative I call the Family Savings Plan, which I will send to
Congress tomorrow.

We need to cut the tax on capital gains, encourage, encourage risk-takers,
especially those in small businesses, to take those steps that translate
into economic reward, jobs, and a better life for all of us.

We'll do what it takes to invest in America's future. The budget commitment
is there. The money is there. It's there for research and development, R
and D, a record high. It's there for our housing initiative, hope, H-O-P-E,
to help everyone from first-time homebuyers to the homeless. The money's
there to keep our kids drug-free, 70 percent more than when I took office
in 1989. It's there for space exploration, and its there for education,
another record high.

And one more, and one more thing. Last fall at the education summit, the
governors and I agreed to look for ways to help make sure that our kids are
ready to learn the very first day they walk into the classroom. And I've
made good on that commitment by proposing a record increase in funds, an
extra half billion dollars, for something near and dear to all of us: Head
Start.

Education is the one investment that means more for our future, because it
means the most for our children. Real improvement in our schools is not
simply a matter of spending more. It's a matter of asking more, expecting
more, of our schools, our teachers, of our kids, of our parents and of
ourselves. And that's why tonight, and that's why tonight, I am announcing
America's education goals, goals developed with enormous cooperation from
the nation's governors. And if I might I'd like to say I'm very pleased
that Governor Gardner and Governor Clinton, Governor Branstad, Governor
Campbell, all of whom were very key in these discussion, these
deliberations, are with us here tonight.

By the, by the year 2000, every child must start school ready to learn. The
United States must increase the high school graduation rate to no less than
90 percent. And we are going to make sure our schools' diplomas mean
something. In critical subjects, at the fourth, eighth, and 12th grades, we
must assess our students' performance.

By the, by the year 2000 U.S. students must be the first in the world in
math and science achievement. Every American adult must be a skilled,
literate worker and citizen. Every school must offer the kind of
disciplined environment that makes it possible for our kids to learn. And
every school in America must be drug-free.

Ambitious aims? Of course. Easy to do? Far from it. But the future's at
stake. The nation will not accept anything less than excellence in
education.

These investments will help keep America competitive. And I know this about
the American people: we welcome competition. We'll match our ingenuity, our
energy, our experience, and technology our spirit and enterprise against
anyone. But let the competition be free, but let it also be fair. America
is ready.

Since we really mean it, and since we're serious about being ready to meet
our challenge, we're getting our own house in order. We have made real
progress. Seven years ago, the Federal deficit was 6 percent of our gross
national product, 6 percent. In the new budget I sent up two days ago the
deficit is down to 1 percent of GNP.

That budget brings Federal spending under control. It meets the
Gramm-Rudman target. It brings the deficit down further. And balances the
budget by 1993, with no new taxes.

And let me tell you, there's still more than enough Federal spending. For
most of us, $1.2 trillion is still a lot of money.

And once the budget is balanced, we can operate the way every family must
when it has bills to pay. We won't leave it to our children and
grandchildren. Once it's balanced, we will start paying off the national
debt.

And there's something more, and there's something more we owe the
generations of the future: stewardship, the safekeeping of America's
precious environmental inheritance.

As just one sign of how serious we are, we will elevate the Environmental
Protection Agency to Cabinet rank. Not, not more bureaucracy, not more red
tape, but the certainty that here at home, and especially in our dealings
with other nations, environmental issues have the status they deserve.

This year's budget provides over $2 billion in new spending to protect our
environment, with over $1 billion for global change research, and a new
initiative I call America the Beautiful to expand our national parks and
wildlife preserves and improve recreational facilities on public lands.

And something else, something that will help keep this country clean, from
our forest land to the inner cities, and keep America beautiful for
generations to come, the money to plant a billion trees a year.

And tonight, and tonight let me say again to all the members of the
Congress, the American people did not send us here to bicker. There is work
to do, and they sent us here to get it done. And once again, in the spirit
of cooperation I offer my hand to all of you. And let's work together to do
the will of the people--clean air, child care, the educational excellence
act, crime and drugs. It's time to act. The farm bill, transportation
policy, product liability reform, enterprise zones. It's time to act
together.

And there's one thing I hope we can agree on. It's about our commitments.
And I'm talking about Social Security.

To every American out there on Social Security, to every, every American
supporting that system today, and to everyone counting on it when they
retire, we made a promise to you, and we are going to keep it.

We, we rescued the system in 1983 and it's sound again, bipartisan
arrangement. Our budget fully funds today's benefits and it assures that
future benefits will be funded as well. And the last thing we need to do is
mess around with Social Security.

There's one more problem we need to address. We must give careful
consideration to the recommendations of the health care studies under way
now. And that's why tonight, I am asking Dr. Sullivan, Lou Sullivan,
Secretary of Health and Human Services, to lead a Domestic Policy Council
review of recommendations on the quality, accessibility and cost of our
nation's health care system. I am committed to bring the staggering costs
of health care under control.

The State of the Government does indeed depend on many of us in this very
chamber. But the State of the Union depends on all Americans. We must
maintain the democratic decency that makes a nation out of millions of
individuals. And I've been appalled at the recent mail bombings across this
country. Every one of us must confront and condemn racism, anti-Semitism,
bigotry and hate. Not next week, not tomorrow, but right now. Every single
one of us.

The State of the Union depends on whether we help our neighbor, claim the
problems of our community as our own. We've got to step forward when
there's trouble, lend a hand, be what I call a point of light to a stranger
in need. We've got to take the time after a busy day to sit down and read
with our kids, help them with their homework, pass along the values we had
as children. And that's how we sustain the State of the Union.

Every effort is important. It all adds up. It's doing the things that give
democracy meaning. It all adds up to who we are and who we will be.

And let me say, that so long as we remember the American idea, so long as
we live up to the American ideal, the State of the Union will remain sound
and strong.

And to those who worry that we've lost our way, well, I want you to listen
to parts of a letter written by James Markwell, Pvt. 1st Class James
Markwell, a 20-year-old Army medic to the First Battalion, 75th Rangers.
It's dated Dec. 18, the day before our armed forces went into action in
Panama. It's a letter servicemen write--and hope will never, ever be sent.
And sadly, Private Markwell's mother did receive this letter. She passed it
on to me out there in Cincinnati.

And here is some of what he wrote: "I've never been afraid of death, but I
know he is waiting at the corner...I've been trained to kill and to save,
and so has everyone else. I am frightened of what lays beyond the fog, and
yet... do not mourn for me. Revel in the life that I have died to give
you... But most of all, don't forget that the Army was my choice. Something
that I wanted to do. Remember I joined the Army to serve my country and
inure that you are free to do what you want and to live your lives
freely."

Let me add that Private Markwell was among the first to see battle in
Panama, and among the first to fall. But he knew what he believed in. He
carried the idea we call America in his heart.

I began tonight speaking about the changes we've seen this past year. There
is a new world of challenges and opportunities before us. And there is a
need for leadership that only America can provide.

Nearly 40 years ago, in his last address to the Congress, President Harry
Truman predicted such a time would come. He said, "As our world grows
stronger, more united, more attractive to men on both sides of the Iron
Curtain, then inevitably there will come a time of change within the
Communist world." Today, that change is taking place.

For more than 40 years, America and its allies held Communism in check and
insured that democracy would continue to exist. And today, with Communism
crumbling, our aim must be to insure democracy's advance, to take the lead
in forging peace and freedom's best hope, a great and growing commonwealth
of free nations.

And to the Congress and to all Americans, I say it is time to acclaim a new
consensus at home and abroad, a common vision of the peaceful world we want
to see.

Here in our own hemisphere it is time for all the people of the Americas,
North and South, to live in freedom.

In the Far East and Africa, it's time for the full flowering of free
governments and free markets that have served the engine of progress.

It is time to offer our hand to the emerging democracies of Eastern Europe
so that continent, for too long a continent divided, can see a future whole
and free.

It's time to build on our new relationship with the Soviet Union, to
endorse and encourage a peaceful process of internal change toward
democracy and economic opportunity.

We are in a period of great transition, great hope, and yet great
uncertainty. We recognize that the Soviet military threat in Europe is
diminishing, but we see little change in Soviet strategic modernization.
And, therefore, we must sustain our own strategic offense modernization and
the Strategic Defense Initiative.

But the time is right to move forward on a conventional arms control
agreement to move us to more appropriate levels of military forces in
Europe, a coherent defense program that insures the U.S. will continue to
be a catalyst for peaceful change in Europe. And I've consulted with
leaders of NATO. In fact I spoke by phone with President Gorbachev just
today.

And I agree with our European allies that an American military presence in
Europe is essential and that it should not be solely tied to the Soviet
military presence in Eastern Europe.

But our troop levels can still be lower. And so tonight I am announcing a
major new step for a further reduction in U.S. and Soviet manpower in
Central and Eastern Europe to 195,000 on each side.

This number, this number, this level, reflects the advice of our senior
military advisers. It's designed to protect American and European interests
and sustain NATO's defense strategy. A swift conclusion to our arms control
talks--conventional, chemical and strategic--must now be our goal. And
that time has come.

Still, we must recognize an unfortunate fact: in many regions of the world
tonight the reality is conflict, not peace. Enduring animosities and
opposing interests remain. And thus the cause of peace must be served by an
America strong enough and sure enough to defend our interests and our
ideals. It's this American idea that for the past four decades helped
inspire the Revolution of '89.

And here at home, and in the world, there is history in the making, and
history to be made. Six months ago, early in this season of change, I stood
at the gates of the Gdansk shipyard in Poland at the monument to the fallen
workers of Solidarity. It's a monument of simple majesty. Three tall
crosses rise up from the stones, and atop each cross, an anchor, an ancient
symbol of hope.

The anchor in our world today is freedom. Holding us steady in times of
change, a symbol of hope to all the world. And freedom is at the very heart
of the idea that is America. Giving life to the idea depends on every one
of us. Our anchor has always been faith and family.

In the last few days of this past monumentous year, our family was blessed
once more, celebrating the joy of life when a little boy became our 12th
grandchild. When I held the little guy for the first time, the troubles at
home and abroad seemed manageable, and totally in perspective.

And now I know, I know you're probably thinking, Well, that's just a
grandfather talking.

Well, maybe you're right. But I've met a lot of children this past year
across this country, as all of you have. Everywhere from the Far East to
Eastern Europe. All kids are unique. Yet, all kids are alike. The budding
young environmentalist I met this month, who joined me in exploring the
Florida Everglades. The Little Leaguers I played catch with in Poland,
ready to go from Warsaw to the World Series. And even the kids who are ill
or alone--and God bless those boarder babies, born addicted to drugs and
AIDS--coping with problems no child should have to face. But, you know,
when it comes to hope and the future, every kid is the same: full of
dreams, ready to take on the world, all special because they are the very
future of freedom. And to them belongs this new world I've been speaking
about.

And so tonight, I'm going to ask something of every one of you. Now let me
start with my generation, with the grandparents out there. You are our
living link with the past. Tell your grandchildren the story of struggles
waged at home and abroad, of sacrifices freely made for freedom's sake. And
tell them your own story as well, because every American has a story to
tell.

And parents, your children look to you for direction and guidance. Tell
them of faith and family. Tell them we are one nation under God. Teach them
that of all the many gifts they can receive, liberty is their most precious
legacy. And of all the gifts they can give, the greatest, the greatest is
helping others.

And to the children and young people out there tonight, with you rests our
hope, all that America will mean in the years and decades ahead. Fix your
vision on a new century, your century, on dreams we cannot see, on the
destiny that is yours and yours alone.

And finally, let all Americans, all of us here in this chamber, the
symbolic center of democracy, affirm our allegiance to this idea we call
America. And let us remember that the State of the Union depends upon each
and every one of us.

God bless all of you. And may God bless this great nation, the United
States of America.

1991:
Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, members of the United States Congress.

I come to this house of the people to speak to you and all Americans,
certain we stand at a defining hour.

Halfway around the world, we are engaged in a great struggle in the skies
and on the seas and sands. We know why we're there. We are Americans--part
of something larger than ourselves.

For two centuries we've done the hard work of freedom. And tonight we lead
the world in facing down a threat to decency and humanity.

What is at stake is more than one small country, it is a big idea--a new
world order, where diverse nations are drawn together in common cause to
achieve the universal aspirations of mankind: peace and security, freedom,
and the rule of law. Such is a world worthy of our struggle, and worthy of
our children's future.

The community of nations has resolutely gathered to condemn and repel
lawless aggression. Saddam Hussein's unprovoked invasion--his ruthless,
systematic rape of a peaceful neighbor--violated everything the community
of nations holds dear. The world has said this aggression would not stand,
and it will not stand.

Together, we have resisted the trap of appeasement, cynicism and isolation
that gives temptation to tyrants. The world has answered Saddam's invasion
with 12 United Nations resolutions, starting with a demand for Iraq's
immediate and unconditional withdrawal, and backed up by forces from 28
countries of six continents. With few exceptions, the world now stands as
one.

The end of the cold war has been a victory for all humanity. A year and a
half ago, in Germany, I said our goal was a Europe whole and free. Tonight,
Germany is united. Europe has become whole and free, and America's
leadership was instrumental in making it possible.

The principle that has guided us is simple: our objective is to help the
Baltic peoples achieve their aspirations, not to punish the Soviet Union.
In our recent discussions with the Soviet leadership we have been given
representations, which, if fulfilled, would result in the withdrawal of
some Soviet forces, a re-opening of dialogue with the republics, and a move
away from violence.

We will watch carefully as the situation develops. And we will maintain our
contact with the Soviet leadership to encourage continued commitment to
democratization and reform.

If it is possible, I want to continue to build a lasting basis for
U.S.-Soviet cooperation, for a more peaceful future for all mankind.

The triumph of democratic ideas in Eastern Europe and Latin America, and
the continuing struggle for freedom elsewhere around the world all confirm
the wisdom of our nation's founders.

Tonight, we work to achieve another victory, a victory over tyranny and
savage aggression.

We in this Union enter the last decade of the 20th Century thankful for all
our blessings, steadfast in our purpose, aware of our difficulties and
responsive to our duties at home and around the world.

For two centuries, America has served the world as an inspiring example of
freedom and democracy. For generations, America has led the struggle to
preserve and extend the blessings of liberty. And today, in a rapidly
changing world, American leadership is indispensable. Americans know that
leadership brings burdens, and requires sacrifice.

But we also know why the hopes of humanity turn to us. We are Americans; we
have a unique responsibility to do the hard work of freedom. And when we
do, freedom works.

The conviction and courage we see in the Persian Gulf today is simply the
American character in action. The indomitable spirit that is contributing
to this victory for world peace and justice is the same spirit that gives
us the power and the potential to meet our challenges at home.

We are resolute and resourceful. If we can selflessly confront evil for the
sake of good in a land so far away, then surely we can make this land all
it should be.

If anyone tells you America's best days are behind her, they're looking the
wrong way.

Tonight, I come before this house, and the American people, with an appeal
for renewal. This is not merely a call for new government initiatives, it
is a call for new initiative in government, in our communities, and from
every American--to prepare for the next American century.

America has always led by example. So who among us will set this example?
Which of our citizens will lead us in this next American century? Everyone
who steps forward today, to get one addict off drugs; to convince one
troubled teen-ager not to give up on life; to comfort one AIDS patient; to
help one hungry child.

We have within our reach the promise of renewed America. We can find
meaning and reward by serving some purpose higher than ourselves--a
shining purpose, the illumination of a thousand points of light. It is
expressed by all who know the irresistible force of a child's hand, of a
friend who stands by you and stays there--a volunteer's generous gesture,
an idea that is simply right.

The problems before us may be different, but the key to solving them
remains the same: it is the individual--the individual who steps forward.
And the state of our Union is the union of each of us, one to the other:
the sum of our friendships, marriages, families and communities.

We all have something to give. So if you know how to read, find someone who
can't. If you've got a hammer, find a nail. If you're not hungry, not
lonely, not in trouble--seek out someone who is.

Join the community of conscience. Do the hard work of freedom. That will
define the state of our Union.

Since the birth of our nation, "we the people" has been the source of our
strength. What government can do alone is limited, but the potential of the
American people knows no limits.

We are a nation of rock-solid realism and clear-eyed idealism. We are
Americans. We are the nation that believes in the future. We are the nation
that can shape the future.

And we've begun to do just that, by strengthening the power and choice of
individuals and families.

Together, these last two years, we've put dollars for child care directly
in the hands of patients instead of bureaucracies, unshackled the potential
of Americans with disabilities, applied the creativity of the marketplace in
the service of the environment, for clean air, and made homeownership
possible for more Americans.

The strength of a democracy is not in bureaucracy, it is in the people and
their communities. In everything we do, let us unleash the potential of our
most precious resource--our citizens. We must return to families,
communities, counties, cities, states and institutions of every kind, the
power to chart their own destiny, and the freedom and opportunity provided
by strong economic growth. That's what America is all about.

I know, tonight, in some regions of our country, people are in genuine
economic distress. I hear them.

Earlier this month Kathy Blackwell of Massachusetts wrote me about what can
happen when the economy slows down, saying, "My heart is aching, and I
think that you should know--your people out here are hurting badly."

I understand. And I'm not unrealistic about the future. But there are
reasons to be optimistic about our economy.

First, we don't have to fight double-digit inflation. Second, most
industries won't have to make big cuts in production because they don't
have big inventories piled up. And third, our exports are running solid and
strong. In fact, American businesses are exporting at a record rate.

So let's put these times in perspective. Together, since 1981, we've
created almost 20 million jobs, cut inflation in half and cut interest
rates in half.

Yes, the largest peacetime economic expansion in history has been
temporarily interrupted. But our economy is still over twice as large as
our closest competitor.

We will get this recession behind us and return to growth soon. We will get
on our way to a new record of expansion, and achieve the competitive
strength that will carry us into the next American century.

We should focus our efforts today on encouraging economic growth, investing
in the future and giving power and opportunity to the individual.

We must begin with control of Federal spending. That's why I'm submitting a
budget that holds the growth in spending to less than the rate of
inflation. And that's why, amid all the sound and fury of last year's
budget debate, we put into law new, enforceable spending caps so that
future spending debates will mean a battle of ideas, not a bidding war.

Though controversial, the budget agreement finally put the Federal
Government on a pay-as-you-go basis, and cut the growth of debt by nearly
$500 billion. And that frees funds for saving and job-creating investment.

Now, let's do more. My budget again includes tax-free family savings
accounts; penalty-free withdrawals from I. R. A.'s for first-time
homebuyers; and, to increase jobs and growth, a reduced tax for long-term
capital gains.

I know their are differences among us about the impact and the effects of a
capital gains incentive. So tonight I am asking the Congressional leaders
and the Federal Reserve to cooperate with us in a study, led by Chairman
Alan Greenspan, to sort out our technical differences so that we can avoid
a return to unproductive partisan bickering.

But just as our efforts will bring economic growth now and in the future,
they must also be matched by long-term investments for the next American
century.

That requires a forward-looking plan of action, and that's exactly what we
will be sending to the Congress. We have prepared a detailed series of
proposals, that include: A budget that promotes investment in America's
future--in children, education, infrastructure, space and high technology.
Legislation to achieve excellence in education, building on the partnership
forged with the 50 governors at the education summit, enabling parents to
choose their children's schools and helping to make America No. 1 in math
and science. A blueprint for a new national highway system, a critical
investment in our transportation infrastructure. A research and development
agenda that includes record levels of Federal investment and a permanent
tax credit to strengthen private R and D and create jobs. A comprehensive
national energy strategy that calls for energy conservation and efficiency,
increased development and greater use of alternative fuels. A banking
reform plan to bring America's financial system into the 21st Century, so
that our banks remain safe and secure and can continue to make job-creating
loans for our factories, businesses, and homebuyers. I do think there has
been too much pessimism. Sound banks should be making more sound loans,
now. And interest rates should be lower, now. In addition to these
proposals, we must recognize that our economic strength depends upon being
competitive in world markets. We must continue to expand America's exports.
A successful Uruguay Round of world trade negotiations will create more
real jobs, and more real growth, for all nations. You and I know that if
the playing field is level, America's workers and farmers can outwork and
outproduce anyone, anytime, anywhere.

And with the Mexican free trade agreement and our Enterprise for the
Americas Initiative we can help our partners strengthen their economies and
move toward a free trade zone throughout this entire hemisphere.

The budget also includes a plan of action right here at home to put more
power and opportunity in the hands of the individual. That means new
incentives to create jobs in our inner cities by encouraging investment
through enterprise zones. It also means tenant control and ownership of
public housing. Freedom and the power to choose should not be the privilege
of wealth. They are the birthright of every American.

Civil rights are also crucial to protecting equal opportunity. Every one of
us has a responsibility to speak out against racism, bigotry, and hate. We
will continue our vigorous enforcement of existing statutes, and I will once
again press the Congress to strengthen the laws against employment
discrimination without resorting to the use of unfair preferences.

We're determined to protect another fundamental civil right: freedom from
crime and the fear that stalks our cities. The Attorney General will soon
convene a crime summit of the nation's law-enforcement officials. And to
help us support them we need a tough crime control legislation, and we need
it now.

As we fight crime, we will fully implement our nation strategy for
combatting drug abuse. Recent data show we are making progress, but much
remains to be done. We will not rest until the day of the dealer is over,
forever.

Good health care is every American's right and every American's
responsibility. So we are proposing an aggression program of new prevention
initiatives--for infants, for children, for adults, and for the elderly--
to promote a healthier America and to help keep costs from spiraling.

It's time to give people more choice in government by reviving the ideal of
the citizen politician who comes not to stay, but to serve. One of the
reasons there is so much support for term limitations is that the American
people are increasingly concerned about big-money influence in politics.
We must look beyond the next election, to the next generation. The time has
come to put the national interest ahead of the special interest--and
totally eliminate political action committees.

That would truly put more competition in elections and more power in the
hands of individuals. And where power cannot be put directly into the hands
of the individual, it should be moved closer to the people--away from
Washington.

The federal government too often treats government programs as if they are
of Washington, by Washington, and for Washington. Once established, federal
programs seem to become immortal.

It's time for a more dynamic program life cycle. Some programs should
increase. Some should decrease. Some should be terminated. And some should
be consolidated and turned over to the states.

My budget includes a list of programs for potential turnover totaling more
than $20 billion. Working with Congress and the governors, I propose we
select at least $15 billion in such programs and turn them over to the
states in a single consolidated grant, fully funded, for flexible
management by the states.

The value of this turnover approach is straightforward. It allows the
Federal Government to reduce overhead. It allows states to manage more
flexibly and more efficiently. It moves power and decision-making closer to
the people. And it re-enforces a theme of this Administration: appreciation
and encouragement of the innovative power of "states as laboratories."

This nation was founded by leaders who understood that power belongs in the
hands of the people. They planned for the future. And so must we--here and
around the world.

As Americans, we know there are times when we must step forward and accept
our responsibility to lead the world away from the dark chaos of dictators,
toward the bright promise of a better day.

Almost 50 years ago, we began a long struggle against aggressive
totalitarianism. Now we face another defining hour for America and the
world.

There is no one more devoted, more committed to the hard work of freedom,
than every soldier and sailor, every marine, airman and coastguardsman--
every man and every woman now serving in the Persian Gulf.

Each of them has volunteered to provide for this nation's defense. And now
they bravely struggle to earn for America and for the world and for future
generations, a just and lasting peace.

Our commitment to them must be equal of their commitment to our country.
They are truly America's finest.

The war in the gulf is not a war we wanted. We worked hard to avoid war.
For more than five months we, along with the Arab League, the European
Community and the United Nations, tried every diplomatic avenue. U.N.
Secretary General Perez de Cuellar; Presidents Gorbachev, Mitterand, Ozal,
Mubarak, and Bendjedid; Kings Fahd and Hassan; Prime Ministers Major and
Andreotti--just to name a few--all worked for a solution. But time and
again Saddam Hussein flatly rejected the path of diplomacy and peace.

The world well knows how this conflict began, and when: it began on August
2nd, when Saddam invaded and sacked a small, defenseless neighbor. And I am
certain of how it will end. So that peace can prevail, we will prevail.

Tonight I'm pleased to report that we are on course. Iraq's capacity to
sustain war is being destroyed. Our investment, our training, our planning
--all are paying off. Time will not be Saddam's salvation.

Our purpose in the Persian Gulf remains constant: to drive Iraq out from
Kuwait, to restore Kuwait's legitimate government, and to insure the
stability and security of this critical region.

Let me make clear what I mean by the region's stability and security. We do
not seek the destruction of Iraq, its culture or its people. Rather, we
seek an Iraq that uses its great resources not to destroy, not to serve the
ambitions of a tyrant, but to build a better life for itself and its
neighbors. We seek a Persian Gulf where conflict is no longer the rule,
where the strong are neither tempted nor able to intimidate the weak.

Most Americans know instinctively why we are in the Gulf. They know we had
to stop Saddam now, not later. They know this brutal dictator will do
anything, will use any weapon, will commit any outrage, no matter how many
innocents must suffer.

They know we must make sure that control of the world's oil resources does
not fall into his hands only to finance further aggression. They know that
we need to build a new, enduring peace--based not on arms races and
confrontation, but on shared principles and the rule of law.

And we all realize that our responsibility to be the catalyst for peace in
the region does not end with the successful conclusion of this war.

Democracy brings the undeniable value of thoughtful dissent, and we have
heard some dissenting voices here at home, some reckless, most responsible.
But the fact the all the voices have the right to speak out is one of the
reasons we've been united in principle and purpose for 200 years.

Our progress in this great struggle is the result of years of vigilance and
a steadfast commitment to a strong defense. Now, with remarkable
technological advances like the Patriot missile, we can defend the
ballistic missile attacks aimed at innocent civilians.

Looking forward, I have directed that the S.D.I. program be refocused on
providing protection from limited ballistic missile strikes, whatever their
source. Let us pursue an S.D.I. program that can deal with any future
threat to the United States, to our forces overseas and to our friends and
allies.

The quality of American technology, thanks to the American worker, has
enabled us to successfully deal with difficult military conditions, and
help minimize the loss of life. We have given our men and women the very
best. And they deserve it.

We all have a special place in our hearts for the families of men and women
serving in the Gulf. They are represented here tonight, by Mrs. Norman
Schwarzkopf, and to all those serving with him. And to the families, let me
say, our forces in the gulf will not stay there one day longer than is
necessary to complete their mission.

The courage and success of the R.A.F. pilots--of the Kuwaiti, Saudi,
French, Canadians, Italians, the pilots of Qatar and Bahrain--all are
proof that for the first time since World War II, the international
community is united. The leadership of the United Nations, once only a
hoped-for ideal, is now confirming its founders' vision.

I am heartened that we are not being asked to bear alone the financial
burden of this struggle. Last year, our friends and allies provided the
bulk of the economic costs of Desert Shield, and having now received
commitments of over $40 billion for the first three months of 1991, I am
confident they will do no less as we move through Desert Storm.

But the world has to wonder what the dictator of Iraq is thinking. If he
thinks that by targeting innocent civilians in Israel and Saudi Arabia,
that he will gain an advantage--he is dead wrong. If he thinks that he
will advance his cause through tragic and despicable environmental
terrorism--he is dead wrong. And if he thinks that by abusing coalition
P.O.W.s, he will benefit--he is dead wrong.

We will succeed in the Gulf. And when we do, the world community will have
sent an enduring warning to any dictator or despot, present or future, who
contemplates outlaw aggression.

The world can therefore seize this opportunity to fulfill the long-held
promise of a new world order--where brutality will go unrewarded, and
aggression will meet collective resistance.

Yes, the United States bears a major share of leadership in this effort.
Among the nations of the world, only the United States of America has had
both the moral standing, and the means to back it up. We are the only
nation on this earth that could assemble the forces of peace.

This is the burden of leadership--and the strength that has made America
the beacon of freedom in a searching world.

This nation has never found glory in war. Our people have never wanted to
abandon the blessings of home and work, for distant lands and deadly
conflict. If we fight in anger, it is only because we have to fight at all.
And all of us yearn for a world where we will never have to fight again.

Each of us will measure, within ourselves, the value of this great
struggle. Any cost in lives is beyond our power to measure. But the cost of
closing our eyes to aggression is beyond mankind's power to imagine.

This we do know: Our cause is just. Our cause is moral. Our cause is
right.

Let future generations understand the burden and the blessings of freedom.
Let them say, we stood where duty required us to stand.

Let them know that together, we affirmed America, and the world, as a
community of conscience.

The winds of change are with us now. The forces of freedom are united. We
move toward the next century, more confident than ever, that we have the
will at home and abroad, to do what must be done--the hard work of
freedom.

May God bless the United States of America.

1992:
Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, distinguished members of Congress, honored
guests and fellow citizens:

I mean to speak tonight of big things, of big changes and the promises they
hold and of some big problems and how together we can solve them and move
our country forward as the undisputed leader of the age.

We gather tonight at a dramatic and deeply promising time in our history,
and in the history of man on earth. For in the past 12 months, the world
has known changes of almost biblical proportions. And even now, months
after the failed coup that doomed a failed system, I am not sure we have
absorbed the full impact, the full import of what happened.

But Communism died this year. Even as President, with the most fascinating
possible vantage point, there were times when I was so busy helping to
manage progress and lead change that I didn't always show the joy that was
in my heart But the biggest thing that has happened in the world in my
life, in our lives, is this: By the grace of God, America won the Cold War.
And there's another to be singled out, though it may seem inelegant. I mean
a mass of people called the American taxpayer. No ever thinks to thank the
people who pay country's bill or an alliance's bill. But for a half Century
now, the American people have shouldered the burden and paid taxes that
were higher than they would have been to support a defense that was bigger
than it would have been if imperial communism had never existed. But it
did. But it doesn't anymore. And here is a fact I wouldn't mind the world
acknowledging: The American taxpayer bore the brunt of the burden, and
deserves a hunk of the glory.

And so, now, for the first time in 35 years, our strategic bombers stand
down. No longer are they on round-the-clock alert. Tomorrow our children
will go to school and study history and how plants grow. And they won't
have, as my children did, air-raid drills in which they crawl under their
desks and cover their heads in case of nuclear war. My grandchildren don't
have to do that, and won't have the bad dreams children once had in decades
past. There are still threats. But the long drawn-out dread is over.

A year ago tonight I spoke to you at a moment of high peril. American
forces had just unleashed Operation Desert Storm. And after 40 days in the
desert skies and 4 days on the ground, the men and women of America's armed
forces and our allies accomplished the goals that I declared, and that you
endorsed: we liberated Kuwait.

Soon after, the Arab world and Israel sat down to talk seriously, and
comprehensively, about peace, an historic first. And soon after that, at
Christmas, the last American hostages came home. Our policies were
vindicated.

Much good can come from the prudent use of power. And much good can come
from this: A world once divided into two armed camps now recognizes one
sole and pre-eminent power, the United States of America. And this they
regard with no dread. For the world trusts us with power, and the world is
right. They trust us to be fair, and restrained. They trust us to be on the
side of decency. They trust us to do what's right.

I use those words advisedly. A few days after the war began, I received a
telegram from Joanne Speicher, the wife of the first pilot killed in the
gulf, Lieutenant Commander Scott Speicher. Even in her grief, she wanted me
to know that some day, when her children were old enough, she would tell
them "that their father went away to war because it was the right thing to
do". She said it all. It was the right thing to do.

And we did it together. There were honest differences here, in this
chamber. But when the war began, you put your partisanship aside and
supported our troops. This is still a time for pride, but this is no time
to boast. For problems face us, and we must stand together once again and
solve them--and not let our country down.

Two years ago, I began planning cuts in military spending that reflected
the changes of the new era. But now, this year, with Imperial Communism
gone, that process can be accelerated. Tonight I can tell you of dramatic
changes in our strategic nuclear force. These are actions we are taking on
our own, because they are the right thing to do.

After completing 20 planes for which we have begun procurement, we will
shut down production of the B-2 bomber. We will cancel the ICBM program. We
will cease production of new warheads for our sea-based missiles. We will
stop all production of the peacekeeper missile. And we will not purchase
any more advanced cruise missiles.

This weekend I will meet at Camp David with Boris Yeltsin of the Russian
Federation. I have informed President Yeltsin that if the commonwealth, the
former Soviet Union, will eliminate all land-based multiple-warhead
ballistic missiles, I will do the following: We will eliminate all
Peacekeeper missiles. We will reduce the number of warheads on Minuteman
missiles to one and reduce the number of warheads on our sea-based missiles
by about one-third. And we will convert a substantial portion of our
strategic to primarily conventional use.

President Yeltsin's early response has been very positive, and I expect our
talks at Camp David to be fruitful. I want you to know that for half a
century, American presidents have longed to make such decisions and say
such words. But even in the midst of celebration, we must keep caution as a
friend. For the world is still a dangerous place. Only the dead have seen
the end of conflict. And though yesterday's challenges are behind us,
tomorrow's are being born.

The Secretary of defense recommended these cuts after consultation with the
joint chiefs of staff. And I make them with confidence. But do not
misunderstand me: The reductions I have approved will save us an additional
$50 billion over the next five years. By 1997 we will have cut defense by
30 percent since I took office. These cuts are deep, and you must know my
resolve: this deep, and no deeper. To do less would be insensible to
progress, but to do more would be ignorant of history. We must not go back
to the days of "the hollow army". We cannot repeat the mistakes made twice
in this century when armistice was followed by recklessness and defense was
purged as if the world was permanently safe.

I remind you this evening that I have asked for your support in funding a
program to protect our country from limited nuclear missile attack. We must
have this protection because too many people in too many countries have
access to nuclear arms. There are those who say that now we can turn away
from the world, that we have no special role, no special place. But we are
the United States of America, the leader of the West that has become the
leader of the world.

As long as I am President we will continue to lead in support of freedom
everywhere, not out of arrogance and not out of altruism, but for the
safety and security of our children. This is a fact: Strength in the
pursuit of peace is no vice; isolationism in the pursuit of security is no
virtue.

Now to our troubles at home. They are not all economic, but the primary
problem is our economy. There are some good signs. Inflation, that thief,
is down, and interest rates are down. But unemployment is too high, some
industries are in trouble and growth is not what it should be. Let me tell
you right from the start and right from the heart: I know we're in hard
times, but I know something else: This will not stand.

My friends in this chamber, we can bring the same courage and sense of
common purpose to the economy that we brought to Desert Storm. And we can
defeat hard times together. I believe you will help. One reason is that
you're patriots, and you want the best for your country. And I believe that
in your hearts you want to put partisanship aside and get the job done,
because it's the right thing to do.

The power of America rests in a stirring but simple idea: that people will
do great things if only you set them free. Well, we're going to have to set
the economy free, for if this age of miracles and wonders has taught us
anything, it's that if we can change the world, we can change America.

We must encourage investment. We must make it easier for people to invest
money and make new products, new industries, and new jobs. We must clear
away obstacles to new growth: high taxes, high regulation, red tape, and
yes, wasteful government spending. None of this will happen with a snap of
the fingers, but it will happen. And the test of a plan isn't whether it's
called new or dazzling. The American people aren't impressed by gimmicks.
They're smarter on this score than all of us in this room. The only test of
a plan is, It is sound and will it work? We must have a short-term plan to
address our immediate needs and heat up the economy. And then we need a
long-term plan to keep the combustion going and to guarantee our place in
the world economy.

There are certain things that a president can do without Congress, and I am
going to do them. I have this evening asked major cabinet departments and
federal agencies to institute a 90-day moratorium on any new federal
regulations that could hinder growth. In those 90 days, major departments
and agencies will carry out a top-to-bottom review of all regulations, old
and new, to stop the ones that will hurt growth and speed up those that
will help growth.

Further, for the untold number of hard-working, responsible American
workers and businessmen and women who've been forced to go without needed
bank loans, the banking credit crunch must end. I won't neglect my
responsibility for sound regulations that serve the public good, but
regulatory overkill must be stopped. And I have instructed our government
regulators to stop it.

I have directed Cabinet departments and federal agencies to speed up
pro-growth expenditures as quickly as possible. This should put an extra
$10 billion into the economy in the next six months. And our new
transportation bill provides more than $150 billion for construction and
maintenance projects that are vital to our growth and well-being. That
means jobs building roads, jobs building bridges and jobs building
railways. And I have this evening directed the secretary of the Treasury to
change the federal tax withholding tables. With this change, millions of
Americans from whom the government withholds more than necessary can now
choose to have the government withhold less from their paychecks. Something
tells me a number of taxpayers may take us up on this one. This initiative
could return about $25 billion back into the economy over the next 12
months, money people can use to help pay for clothing, college or a new
car. And finally, working with the Federal Reserve, we will continue to
support monetary policy that keeps both interest rates and inflation down.

Now these are the things that I can do. And now, members of Congress, let
me tell you what you can do for your country. You must, you must pass the
other elements of my plan to meet our economic needs. Everyone knows
investment speeds recovery. And I am proposing this evening a change in the
alternative minimum tax, and the creation of a new 15% investment tax
allowance. This will encourage businesses to accelerate investment and
bring people back to work. Real estate has led our economy out of almost
all the tough times we've ever had. Once building starts, carpenters and
plumbers work, people buy homes and take out mortgages.

My plan would modify the passive-loss rule for active real-estate
developers. And it would make it easier for pension plans to purchase real
estate. For those Americans who dream of buying a first home but who can't
quite afford it, my plan would allow first-time home buyers to withdraw
savings from IRAs without penalty and provide a $5000 tax credit for the
first purchase of that home.

And finally, my immediate plan calls on Congress to give crucial help to
people who own a home, to every one who has a business, a farm or a single
investment.

This time, at this hour, I cannot take "No" for an answer. You must cut the
capital gains tax on the people of this country. Never has an issue been so
demagogued by its opponents. But the demagogues are wrong. They are wrong,
and they know it. Sixty percent of people who benefit from lower capital
gains have incomes under $50,000. A cut in the capital gains tax increases
jobs and helps just about everyone in our country. And so I'm asking you to
cut the capital gains tax to a maximum of 15.4%. And I'll tell you, I'll
tell you, those of you who say, "Oh no, someone who's comfortable may
benefit from this" you kind of remind me of the old definition of the
Puritan, who couldn't sleep at night worrying that somehow someone
somewhere was out having a good time.

The opponents of this measure and those who've authored various so-called
soak-the-rich bills that are floating around this chamber should be
reminded of something: When they aim at the big guy, they usually hit the
little guy. And maybe it's time that stopped.

This then is my short-term plan. Your part, members of Congress, requires
enactment of these common-sense proposals that will have a strong effect on
the economy, without breaking the budget agreement and without raising tax
rates. And while my plan is being passed and kicking in, we've got to care
for those in trouble today. I have provided for up to $4.4 billion in my
budget to extend federal unemployment benefits, and I ask for Congressional
action right away. And I thank the committee--well, at last. And let's be
frank. Let's be frank; let me level with you.

I know, and you know, that my plan is unveiled in a political season. I
know, and you know, that everything I propose will be viewed by some in
merely partisan terms. But I ask you to know what is in my heart. And my
aim is to increase our nation's good. And I'm doing what I think is right;
I'm proposing what I know will help. I pride myself that I'm a prudent man,
and I believe that patience is a virtue, but I understand politics is, for
some, a game and that sometimes the game is to stop all progress and then
decry the lack of improvement. But let me tell you, let me tell you, far
more important than my political future--and far more important than
yours--is the well-being of our country. And members of this chamber,
members of this chamber, are practical people, and I know you won't resent
some practical advice: When people put their party's fortunes, whatever the
party, whatever the side of this aisle, before the public good, they court
defeat not only for their country, but for themselves. And they will
certainly deserve it.

And I submit my plan tomorrow. And I am asking you to pass it by March 20.
From the day after that--if it must be--the battle is joined. And you
know, when principle is at stake, I relish a good fair fight.

I said my plan has two parts, and it does. And it's the second part that is
the heart of the matter. For it's not enough to get an immediate burst. We
need long-term improvement in our economic position. We all know that the
key to our economic future is to insure that America continues as the
economic leader of the world. We have that in our power. Here, then, is my
long-term plan to guarantee our future.

First, trade: We will work to break down the walls that stop world trade.
We will work to open markets everywhere. And in our major trade
negotiations, I will continue pushing to eliminate tariffs and subsidies
that damage America's farmers and workers. And we'll get more good American
jobs within our own hemisphere through the North American Free Trade
Agreement, and through the Enterprise for the Americas Initiative. But
changes are here, and more are coming. The work place of the future will
demand more highly skilled workers than ever, people who are computer
literate, highly educated.

And we must be the world's leader in education. And we must revolutionize
America's schools. My America 2000 strategy will help us reach that goal.
My plan will give parents more choice, give teachers more flexibility and
help communities create new American schools. Thirty states across the
nation have established America 2000 programs. Hundreds of cities and towns
have joined. Now Congress must join this great movement. Pass my proposals
for new American schools.

That was my second long-term proposal. And here's my third: We must make
common-sense investments that will help us compete, long-term, in the
marketplace. We must encourage research and development. My plan is to make
the R and D tax credit permanent, and to provide record levels of support,
over $76 billion this year alone for people who explore the promise of
emerging technologies.

And fourth, we must do something about crime and drugs. And it is time for
a major renewed investment in fighting violent street crime. Its saps our
strength and hurts our faith in our society, and in our future together.
Surely a tired woman on her way to work at six in the morning on a subway
deserves the right to get there safely. And surely, it's true that everyone
who changes his or her way of life because of crime--from those afraid to
go our at night to those afraid to walk in the parks they pay for--surely
those people have been denied a basic civil right. It is time to restore
it. Congress, pass my comprehensive crime bill. It is tough on criminals
and supportive of police, and it has been languishing in these hallowed
halls for years now. Pass it. Help your country.

And fifth, I ask you tonight to fund our HOPE housing proposal and to pass
my enterprise-zone legislation, which will get businesses into the inner
city. We must empower the poor with the pride that comes from owning a
home, getting a job, becoming part of things. My plan would encourage real
estate construction by extending tax incentives for mortgage-revenue bonds
and low-income housing. And I ask tonight for record expenditures for the
program that helps children born into want move into excellence: Head
Start.

Step six: We must reform our health care system for this too, bears on
whether or not we can compete in the world. American health costs have been
exploding. This year America will spend over $800 billion on health, and
that is expected to grow to $1.6 trillion by the end of the decade. We
simply cannot afford this. The cost of health care shows up not only in
your family budget, but in the price of everything we buy and everything we
sell. When health coverage for a fellow on the assembly line costs
thousands of dollars, the cost goes into the product he makes. And you pay
the bill. Now we must make a choice.

Now some pretend we can have it both ways: they call it play or pay. But
that expensive approach is unstable. It will mean higher taxes, fewer jobs,
and eventually, a system under complete government control. Really, there
are only two options. And we can move toward a nationalized system, a
system which will restrict patient choice in picking a doctor and force the
government to ration services arbitrarily. And what we'll get is patients
in long lines, indifferent service and a huge new tax burden. Or we can
reform our own private health-care system, which still gives us, for all
its flaws, the best quality health care in the world. Well, let's build on
our strengths.

My plan provides insurance security for all Americans while preserving and
increasing the idea of choice. We make basic health insurance affordable
for all low-income people not now covered. We do it by providing a
health-insurance tax credit of up to $3750 for each low-income family. The
middle class gets help, too. And by reforming the health insurance market,
my plan assures that Americans will have access to basic health insurance
even if they change jobs or develop serious health problem We must bring
costs under control, preserve quality, preserve choice and reduce people's
nagging daily worry about health insurance. My plan, the details of which I
will announce shortly, does just that.

And seventh, we must get the federal deficit under control. We now have in
law, enforcable spending caps, and a requirement that we pay for the
programs we create. There are those in Congress who would ease that
discipline now. But I cannot let them do it. And I won't. My plan would
freeze all domestic discretionary budget authority which means "No more
next year than this year". I will not tamper with Social Security but I
would put real caps on the growth of uncontrolled spending. And I would
also freeze federal domestic government employment. And with the help of
Congress, my plan will get rid of 246 programs that don't deserve federal
funding. Some of them have noble titles, but none of them is indispensible.
We can get rid of each and every one of them.

You know, it's time we rediscovered a home truth the American people have
never forgotten: the government is too big and spends too much. And I call
on Congress to adopt a measure that will help put an end to the annual
ritual of filling the budget with pork-barrel appropriations. Every year,
the press has a field day making fun of outrageous examples, a Lawrence
Welk Museum, a research grant for Belgian Endive. We all know how these
things get into the budget, and maybe you need someone to help you say no.
I know how to say it. And you know what I need to make it stick. Give me
the same thing 43 governors have--the line-item veto--and let me help
you control spending.

We must put an end to unfinanced government mandates. These are the
requirements Congress puts on our cities, counties and states without
supplying the money. And if Congress passes a mandate, it should be forced
to pay for it and balance the cost with savings elsewhere. After all, a
mandate just increases someone else's tax burden, and that means higher
taxes at the state and local level.

Step Eight: Congress should enact the bold reform proposals that are still
awaiting congressional action: bank reform, civil justice reform, tort
reform, and my national energy strategy.

And finally, we must strengthen the family, because it is the family that
has the greatest bearing on our future. When Barbara holds an AIDS baby in
her arms and reads to children, she's saying to every person in this
country, "Family Matters".

And I am announcing tonight a new commission on America's urban families.
I've asked Missouri's governor, John Ashcroft, to be chairman, former
Dallas Mayor Annetter Strauss to be co-chair. You know, I had Mayors, the
leading mayors from the League of Cities, in the other day at the White
House, and they told me something striking. They said that every one of
them, Republican and Democrat, agreed on one thing: That the major cause of
the problems of the cities is the dissolution of the family. And they asked
for this commission, and they were right to ask, because it's time to
determine what we can do to keep families together, strong and sound.

There's one thing we can do right away: Ease the burden of rearing a child.
I ask you tonight to raise the personal exemption by $500 per child for
every family. For a family with four kids, that's an increase of $2000.
This is a good start in the right direction, and it's what we can afford.
It's time to allow families to deduct the interest they pay on student
loans. And I'm asking you to do just that. And I'm asking you to allow
people to use money from their IRAs to pay medical and educational
expenses, all without penalties. And I'm asking for more. Ask American
parents what they dislike about how things are going in our country, and
chances are good that pretty soon they'll get to welfare.

Americans are the most generous people on Earth. But we have to go back to
the insight of Franklin Roosevelt who, when he spoke of what became the
welfare program, want that it must not become a narcotic and a subtle
destroyer of the spirit. Welfare was never meant to be a life style. It was
never meant to be a habit. It was never supposed to be passed on from
generation to generation like a legacy. It's time to replace the
assumptions of the welfare state and help reform the welfare system.

States throughout the country are beginning to operate with new
assumptions: that when able-bodied people receive government assistance
they have responsibilities to the taxpayer. A responsibility to seek work,
education, or job training. A responsibility to get their lives in order. A
responsibility to hold their families together and refrain from having
children out of wedlock. And a responsibility to obey the law. We are going
to help this movement. Often, state reform requires waiving certain federal
regulations. I will act to make that process easier and quicker for every
state that asks our help. And I want to add, as we make these changes, we
work together to improve this system, that our intention is not
scapegoating and finger-pointing. If you read the papers or watch TV you
know there's been a rise these days in a certain kind of ugliness: racist
comments, anti-Semitism, an increased sense of division. Really, this is
not us. This is not who we are. And this is not acceptable.

And so you have my plan for America. And I am asking for big things, but I
believe in my heart you will do what's right.

And you know, it's kind of an American tradition to show a certain
skepticism toward our democratic institutions. I myself have sometimes
thought the aging process could be delayed if it had to make its way
through Congress. But you will deliberate, and you will discuss, and that
is fine. But my friends the people cannot wait. They need help now. And
there's a mood among us. People are worried. There has been talk of
decline. Someone even said our workers are lazy and uninspired. And I
thought, "Really? Go tell Neil Armstrong standing on the moon. Tell the
American farmer who feeds his country and the world. Tell the men and women
of Desert Storm." Moods come and go, but greatness endures. Our does.

And maybe for a moment it's good to remember what, in the dailyness of our
lives, we forget. We are still and ever the freest nation on Earth, the
kindest nation on Earth, the strongest nation on Earth. And we have always
risen to the occasion. And we are going to lift this nation out of hard
times inch by inch and day by day, and those who would stop us better step
aside. Because I look at hard times and I make this vow: This will not
stand. And so we move on, together, a rising nation, the once and future
miracle that is still, this night, the hope of the world.

2001:
To the Congress of the United States:

Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress:

It is a great privilege to be here to outline a new budget and a new approach
for governing our great country. I thank you for your invitation to speak here
tonight. I want to thank so many of you who have accepted my invitation to come
to the White House to discuss important issues. We are off to a good start. I
will continue to meet with you and ask for your input. You have been kind and
candid, and I thank you for making a new President feel welcome.

The last time I visited the Capitol, I came to take an oath. On the steps of
this building, I pledged to honor our Constitution and laws, and I asked you to
join me in setting a tone of civility and respect in Washington. I hope America
is noticing the difference. We are making progress. Together, we are changing
the tone of our Nations capital. And this spirit of respect and cooperation is
vitalbecause in the end, we will be judged not only by what we say or how we
say it, but by what we are able to accomplish.

America today is a nation with great challengesbut greater resources. An artist
using statistics as a brush could paint two very different pictures of our
country. One would have warning signs: increasing layoffs, rising energy prices,
too many failing schools, persistent poverty, the stubborn vestiges of racism.
Another picture would be full of blessings: a balanced budget, big surpluses, a
military that is second to none, a country at peace with its neighbors,
technology that is revolutionizing the world, and our greatest strength,
concerned citizens who care for our country and for each other. Neither picture
is complete in and of itself. And tonight I challenge and invite Congress to
work with me to use the resources of one picture to repaint the otherto direct
the advantages of our time to solve the problems of our people.

Some of these resources will come from governmentsome, but not all. Year after
year in Washington, budget debates seem to come down to an old, tired argument:
on one side, those who want more government, regardless of the cost; on the
other, those who want less government, regardless of the need.

We should leave those arguments to the last century and chart a different
course. Government has a role, and an important one. Yet too much government
crowds out initiative and hard work, private charity and the private economy.
Our new governing vision says government should be active, but limited, engaged,
but not overbearing. My budget is based on that philosophy. It is reasonable and
it is responsible. It meets our obligations and funds our growing needs. We
increase spending next year for Social Security and Medicare and other
entitlement programs by $81 billion. We have increased spending for
discretionary programs by a very responsible 4 percent, above the rate of
inflation. My plan pays down an unprecedented amount of our national debt, and
then when money is still left over, my plan returns it to the people who earned
it in the first place.

A budgets impact is counted in dollars, but measured in lives. Excellent
schools, quality health care, a secure retirement, a cleaner environment, a
stronger defensethese are all important needs and we fund them.

The highest percentage increase in our budget should go to our childrens
education. Education is my top priority and by supporting this budget, you will
make it yours as well. Reading is the foundation of all learning, so during the
next 5 years, we triple spending, adding another $5 billion to help every child
in America learn to read. Values are important, so we have tripled funding for
character education to teach our children not only reading and writing, but
right from wrong.

We have increased funding to train and recruit teachers, because we know a good
education starts with a good teacher. And I have a wonderful partner in this
effort. I like teachers so much, I married one. Please help me salute our
gracious First Lady, Laura Bush.

Laura has begun a new effort to recruit Americans to the profession that will
shape our future: teaching. Laura will travel across America, to promote sound
teaching practices and early reading skills in our schools and in programs such
as Head Start.

When it comes to our schools, dollars alone do not always make the difference.
Funding is important, and so is reform. So we must tie funding to higher
standards and accountability for results.

I believe in local control of schools: we should not and we will not run our
public schools from Washington. Yet when the Federal Government spends tax
dollars, we must insist on results. Children should be tested on basic reading
and math skills every year, between grades three and eight. Measuring is the
only way to know whether all our children are learningand I want to know,
because I refuse to leave any child behind.

Critics of testing contend it distracts from learning. They talk about
teaching to the test. But let us put that logic to the test. If you test
children on basic math and reading skills, and you are teaching to the test,
you are teaching . . . math and reading. And that is the whole idea.

As standards rise, local schools will need more flexibility to meet them. So we
must streamline the dozens of Federal education programs into five and let
States spend money in those categories as they see fit.

Schools will be given a reasonable chance to improve, and the support to do so.
Yet if they do not, if they continue to fail, we must give parents and students
different optionsa better public school, a private school, tutoring, or a
charter school. In the end, every child in a bad situation must be given a
better choice, because when it comes to our children, failure is not an option.

Another priority in my budget is to keep the vital promises of Medicare and
Social Security, and together we will do so. To meet the health care needs of
all Americas seniors, we double the Medicare budget over the next 10 years.

My budget dedicates $238 billion to Medicare next year alone, enough to fund all
current programs and to begin a new prescription drug benefit for lowincome
seniors. No senior in America should have to choose between buying food and
buying prescriptions. To make sure the retirement savings of Americas seniors
are not diverted to any other programmy budget protects all $2.6 trillion of
the Social Security surplus for Social Security and for Social Security alone.

My budget puts a priority on access to health carewithout telling Americans
what doctor they have to see or what coverage they must choose. Many working
Americans do not have health care coverage. We will help them buy their own
insurance with refundable tax credits. And to provide quality care in low-income
neighborhoods, over the next 5 years we will double the number of people served
at community health care centers. And we will address the concerns of those who
have health coverage yet worry their insurance company does not care and will
not pay. Together, this Congress and this President will find common ground to
make sure doctors make medical decisions and patients get the health care they
deserve with a Patients Bill of Rights. When it comes to their health, people
want to get the medical care they need, not be forced to go to court because
they did not get it. We will ensure access to the courts for those with
legitimate claims, but first, let us put in place a strong independent review so
we promote quality health care, not frivolous lawsuits.

My budget also increases funding for medical research, which gives hope to many
who struggle with serious disease. Our prayers tonight are with one of your own
who is engaged in his own fight against cancer, a fine representative and a good
man, Congressman JOE MOAKLEY. God bless you, JOE. And I can think of no more
appropriate tribute to JOE than to have the Congress finish the job of doubling
the budget for the National Institutes of Health. My New Freedom Initiative for
Americans with Disabilities funds new technologies, expands opportunities to
work, and makes our society more welcoming. For the more than 50 million
Americans with disabilities, we must continue to break down barriers to
equality.

The budget I propose to you also supports the people who keep our country strong
and free, the men and women who serve in the United States military. I am
requesting $5.7 billion in increased military pay and benefits, and health care
and housing. Our men and women in uniform give America their best and we owe
them our support. Americas veterans honored their commitment to our country
through their military service. I will honor our commitment to them with a
billion dollar increase to ensure better access to quality care and faster
decisions on benefit claims.

My budget will improve our environment by accelerating the cleanup of toxic
Brownfields. And I propose we make a major investment in conservation by fully
funding the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Our National Parks have a special
place in our countrys life. Our parks are places of great natural beauty and
history. As good stewards, we must leave them better than we have found them, so
I propose providing $4.9 billion in resources over 5 years for the upkeep of
these national treasures.

And my budget adopts a hopeful new approach to help the poor and disadvantaged.
We must encourage and support the work of charities and faithbased and community
groups that offer help and love one person at a time. These groups are working
in every neighborhood in America, to fight homelessness and addiction and
domestic violence, to provide a hot meal or a mentor or a safe haven for our
children. Government should welcome these groups to apply for funds, not
discriminate against them.

Government cannot be replaced by charities or volunteers. And government should
not fund religious activities. But our Nations should support the good works of
these good people who are helping neighbors in need. So I am proposing allowing
all taxpayers, whether they itemize or not, to deduct their charitable
contributions. Estimates show this could encourage as much as $14 billion a year
in new charitable givingmoney that will save and change lives.

Our budget provides more than $700 million over the next 10 years for a Federal
Compassion Capital Fund with a focused and noble mission: to provide a mentor to
the more than 1 million children with a parent in prison, and to support other
local efforts to fight illiteracy, teen pregnancy, drug addiction, and other
difficult problems. With us tonight is the Mayor of Philadelphia. Please help me
welcome Mayor John Street. Mayor Street has encouraged faith-based and community
organizations to make a difference in Philadelphia and he has invited me to his
city this summer, to see compassion in action.

I am personally aware of just how effective the Mayor is. Mayor Street is a
Democrat. Let the record show that I lost his city. But some things are bigger
than politics. So I look forward to coming to your city to see your faithbased
programs in action.

As government promotes compassion, it also must promote justice. Too many of our
citizens have cause to doubt our Nations justice when the law points a finger
of suspicion at groups, instead of individuals. All our citizens are created
equal and must be treated equally. Earlier today I asked Attorney General
Ashcroft to develop specific recommendations to end racial profiling. It is
wrong. We must end it. In so doing, we will not hinder the work of our Nations
brave police officers. They protect us every day, often at great risk. But by
stopping the abuses of a few, we will add to the public confidence our police
officers earn and deserve.

My budget has funded a responsible increase in our ongoing operations, it has
funded our Nations important priorities, it has protected Social Security and
Medicare, and our surpluses are big enough that there is still money left over.

Many of you have talked about the need to pay down our national debt. I have
listened, and I agree.

My budget proposal pays down an unprecedented amount of public debt. We owe it
to our children and grandchildren to act now, and I hope you will join me to pay
down $2 trillion in debt during the next 10 years.

At the end of those 10 years, we will have paid down all the debt that is
available to retire. That is more debt repaid more quickly than has ever been
repaid by any nation at any time in history.

We should also prepare for the unexpected, for the uncertainties of the future.
We should approach our Nations budget as any prudent family would, with a
contingency fund for emergencies or additional spending needs.

For example, after a strategic review, we may need to increase defense spending,
we may need additional money for our farmers, or additional money to reform
Medicare. And so my budget sets aside almost a trillion dollars over 10 years
for additional needs . . . that is one trillion additional reasons you can feel
comfortable supporting this budget. We have increased our budget at a
responsible 4 percent, we have funded our priorities, we have paid down all the
available debt, we have prepared for contingenciesand we still have money left
over.

Yogi Berra once said: When you come to a fork in the road, take it. Now we
come to a fork in the road. We have two choices. Even though we have already met
our needs, we could spend the money on more and bigger government. That is the
road our Nation has traveled in recent years. Last year, government spending
shot up 8 percent. That is far more than our economy grew, far more than
personal income grew and far more than the rate of inflation. If you continue on
that road, you will spend the surplus and have to dip into Social Security to
pay other bills.

Unrestrained government spending is a dangerous road to deficits, so we must
take a different path. The other choice is to let the American people spend
their own money to meet their own needs, to fund their own priorities and pay
down their own debts. I hope you will join me and stand firmly on the side of
the people.

The growing surplus exists because taxes are too high and government is charging
more than it needs. The people of America have been overcharged and on their
behalf, I am here to ask for a refund.

Some say my tax plan is too big, others say it is too small. I respectfully
disagree. This tax relief is just right. I did not throw darts at a board to
come up with a number for tax relief. I did not take a poll, or develop an
arbitrary formula that might sound good. I looked at problems in the tax code
and calculated the cost to fix them. A tax rate of 15 percent is too high for
those who earn low wages, so we lowered the rate to 10 percent. No one should
pay more than a third of the money they earn in Federal income taxes, so we
lowered the top rate to 33 percent. This reform will be welcome relief for
Americas small businesses, which often pay taxes at the highest rate, and help
for small business means jobs for Americans.

We simplified the tax code by reducing the number of tax rates from the current
five rates to four lower ones: 10, 15, 25, and 33 percent. In my plan, no one is
targeted in or targeted out . . . every one who pays income taxes will get tax
relief.

Our government should not tax, and thereby discourage marriage, so we reduced
the marriage penalty. I want to help families rear and support their children,
so we doubled the child credit to $1,000 per child. It is not fair to tax the
same earnings twiceonce when you earn them, and again when you die, so we must
repeal the death tax. These changes add up to significant help. A typical family
with two children will save $1,600 a year on their Federal income taxes. Sixteen
hundred dollars may not sound like a lot to some, but it means a lot to many
families. Sixteen hundred dollars buys gas for two cars for an entire year, it
pays tuition for a year at a community college, it pays the average family
grocery bill for 3 months. That is real money.

With us tonight, representing many American families, are Steven and Josefina
Ramos. Please help me welcome them. The Ramoses are from Pennsylvania, but they
could be from any one of your districts. Steven is a network administrator for a
school district, Josefina is a Spanish teacher at a charter school, and they
have a 2-yearold daughter, Lianna. Steven and Josefina tell me they pay almost
$8,000 a year in Federal income taxes; my plan will same them more than $2,000.
Let me tell you what Steven says:

Two thousand dollars a year means a lot to my family. If we had this money, it
would help us reach our goal of paying off our personal debt in two years.
After that, Steven and Josefina want to start saving for Liannas college
education. Government should never stand in the way of families achieving their
dreams. The surplus is not the governments money, the surplus is the peoples
money.

For lower-income families, my tax relief plan restores basic fairness. Right
now, complicated tax rules punish hard work. A waitress supporting two children
on $25,000 a year can lose nearly half of every additional dollar she earns. Her
overtime, her hardest hours, are taxed at nearly 50 percent. This sends a
terrible message: You will never get ahead. But Americas message must be
different: We must honor hard work, never punish it.

With tax relief, overtime will no longer be overtax time for the waitress.
People with the smallest incomes will get the highest percentage reductions. And
millions of additional American families will be removed from the income tax
rolls entirely.

Tax relief is right and tax relief is urgent. The long economic expansion that
began almost 10 years ago is faltering. Lower interest rates will eventually
help, but we cannot assume they will do the job all by themselves. Forty years
ago and then twenty years ago, two Presidents, one Democrat and one Republican,
John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan, advocated tax cuts toin President Kennedys
wordsget this country moving again.

They knew then, what we must do now: To create economic growth and opportunity,
we must put money back into the hands of the people who buy goods and create
jobs.

We must act quickly. The Chairman of the Federal Reserve has testified before
Congress that tax cuts often come too late to stimulate economic recovery. So I
want to work with you to give our economy an important jump start by making tax
relief retroactive. We must act now because it is the right thing to do. We must
also act now because we have other things to do. We must show courage to
confront and resolve tough challenges: to restructure our Nations defenses, to
meet our growing need for energy, and to reform Medicare and Social Security.
America has a window of opportunity to extend and secure our present peace by
promoting a distinctly American internationalism. We will work with our allies
and friends to be a force for good and a champion of freedom. We will work for
free markets and free trade and freedom from oppression. Nations making progress
toward freedom will find America is their friend. We will promote our values,
and we will promote peace. And we need a strong military to keep the peace. But
our military was shaped to confront the challenges of the past. So I have asked
the Secretary of Defense to review Americas armed forces and prepare to
transform them to meet emerging threats. My budget makes a downpayment on the
research and development that will be required. Yet, in our broader
transformation effort, we must put strategy first, then spending. Our defense
vision will drive our defense budget, not the other way around. Our Nation also
needs a clear strategy to confront the threats of the 21st century, threats that
are more widespread and less certain. They range from terrorists who threaten
with bombs to tyrants and rogue nations intent on developing weapons of mass
destruction. To protect our own people, our allies and friends, we must develop
and we must deploy effective missile defenses.

And as we transform our military, we can discard Cold War relics, and reduce our
own nuclear forces to reflect todays needs.

A strong America is the worlds best hope for peace and freedom. Yet the cause
of freedom rests on more than our ability to defend ourselves and our allies.
Freedom is exported every day, as we ship goods and products that improve the
lives of millions of people. Free trade brings greater political and personal
freedom.

Each of the previous five Presidents has had the ability to negotiate
farreaching trade agreements. Tonight I ask you to give me the strong hand of
presidential trade promotion authority, and to do so quickly.

As we meet tonight, many citizens are struggling with the high costs of energy.
We have a serious energy problem that demands a national energy policy. The West
is confronting a major energy shortage that has resulted in high prices and
uncertainty. I have asked Federal agencies to work with California officials to
help speed construction of new energy sources. And I have directed Vice
President CHENEY, Commerce Secretary Evans, Energy Secretary Abraham, and other
senior members of my Administration to recommend a national energy policy.

Our energy demand outstrips our supply. We can produce more energy at home while
protecting our environment, and we must. We can produce more electricity to meet
demand, and we must. We can promote alternative energy sources and conservation,
and we must. America must become more energy independent.

Perhaps the biggest test of our foresight and courage will be reforming Medicare
and Social Security. Medicares finances are strained and its coverage is
outdated. Ninety-nine percent of employer-provided health plans offer some form
of prescription drug coverage . . . Medicare does not. The framework for reform
has been developed by Senators FRIST and BREAUX and Congressman THOMAS, and now,
it is time to act. Medicare must be modernized. And we must make sure that every
senior on Medicare can choose a health plan that offers prescription drugs.

Seven years from now, the baby boom generation will begin to claim Social
Security benefits. Everyone in this chamber knows that Social Security is not
prepared to fully fund their retirement. And we only have a couple of years to
get prepared. Without reform, this country will one day awaken to a stark
choice: either a drastic rise in payroll taxes, or a radical cut in retirement
benefits. There is a better way.

This spring I will form a presidential commission to reform Social Security. The
commission will make its recommendations by next fall. Reform should be based on
these principles: It must preserve the benefits of all current retirees and
those nearing retirement. It must return Social Security to sound financial
footing. And it must offer personal savings accounts to younger workers who want
them. Social Security now offers workers a return of less than 2 percent on the
money they pay into the system. To save the system, we must increase that by
allowing younger workers to make safe, sound investments at a higher rate of
return.

Ownership, access to wealth, and independence should not be the privilege of a
few. They are the hope of every American . . . and we must make them the
foundation of Social Security. By confronting the tough challenge of reform, by
being responsible with our budget, we can earn the trust of the American people.
And, we can add to that trust by enacting fair and balanced election and
campaign finance reforms.

The agenda I have set before you tonight is worthy of a great country. America
is a nation at peace, but not a nation at rest. Much has been given to us, and
much is expected. Let us agree to bridge old divides. But let us also agree that
our good will must be dedicated to great goals. Bipartisanship is more than
minding our manners, it is doing our duty. No one can speak in this Capitol and
not be awed by its history. At so many turning points, debates in these chambers
have reflected the collected or divided conscience of our country. And when we
walk through Statuary Hall, and see those men and women of marble, we are
reminded of their courage and achievement.

Yet Americas purpose is never found in statues or history. Americas purpose
always stands before us. Our generation must show courage in a time of blessing,
as our Nation has always shown in times of crisis. And our courage issue by
issue, can gather to greatness, and serve our country. This is the privilege,
and responsibility, we share. And if we work together, we can prove that public
service is noble.

We all came here for a reason. We all have things we want to accomplish, and
promises to keep. Juntos podemos, together we can. We can make Americans proud
of their government. Together we can share in the credit of making our country
more prosperous and generous and justand earn from our conscience and from our
fellow citizens, the highest possible praise: well done, good and faithful
servants.

Thank you. Good night. And God Bless America.

GEORGE W. BUSH.
THE WHITE HOUSE, February 27, 2001.

2002:
Thank you very much. Mr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, Members of Congress,
distinguished guests, fellow citizens: As we gather tonight, our Nation is at
war; our economy is in recession; and the civilized world faces unprecedented
dangers. Yet, the state of our Union has never been stronger.

We last met in an hour of shock and suffering. In 4 short months, our Nation has
comforted the victims, begun to rebuild New York and the Pentagon, rallied a
great coalition, captured, arrested, and rid the world of thousands of
terrorists, destroyed Afghanistan's terrorist training camps, saved a people
from starvation, and freed a country from brutal oppression.

The American flag flies again over our Embassy in Kabul. Terrorists who once
occupied Afghanistan now occupy cells at Guantanamo Bay. And terrorist leaders
who urged followers to sacrifice their lives are running for their own.

America and Afghanistan are now allies against terror. We'll be partners in
rebuilding that country. And this evening we welcomed the distinguished interim
leader of a liberated Afghanistan, Chairman Hamid Karzai.

The last time we met in this Chamber, the mothers and daughters of Afghanistan
were captives in their own homes, forbidden from working or going to school.
Today women are free and are part of Afghanistan's new Government. And we
welcome the new Minister of Women's Affairs, Dr. Sima Samar.

Our progress is a tribute to the spirit of the Afghan people, to the resolve of
our coalition, and to the might of the United States military. When I called our
troops into action, I did so with complete confidence in their courage and
skill. And tonight, thanks to them, we are winning the war on terror. The men
and women of our Armed Forces have delivered a message now clear to every enemy
of the United States: Even 7,000 miles away, across oceans and continents, on
mountaintops and in caves, you will not escape the justice of this Nation.

For many Americans, these 4 months have brought sorrow and pain that will never
completely go away. Every day a retired firefighter returns to Ground Zero to
feel closer to his two sons who died there. At a memorial in New York, a little
boy left his football with a note for his lost father: "Dear Daddy, please take
this to heaven. I don't want to play football until I can play with you again
some day." Last month, at the grave of her husband, Micheal, a CIA officer and
marine who died in Mazar-e-Sharif, Shannon Spann said these words of farewell,
"Semper Fi, my love." Shannon is with us tonight. Shannon, I assure you and
all who have lost a loved one that our cause is just, and our country will never
forget the debt we owe Michael and all who gave their lives for freedom.

Our cause is just, and it continues. Our discoveries in Afghanistan confirmed
our worst fears and showed us the true scope of the task ahead. We have seen the
depth of our enemies' hatred in videos where they laugh about the loss of
innocent life. And the depth of their hatred is equaled by the madness of the
destruction they design. We have found diagrams of American nuclear powerplants
and public water facilities, detailed instructions for making chemical weapons,
surveillance maps of American cities, and thorough descriptions of landmarks in
America and throughout the world.

What we have found in Afghanistan confirms that, far from ending there, our war
against terror is only beginning. Most of the 19 men who hijacked planes on
September the 11th were trained in Afghanistan's camps, and so were tens of
thousands of others. Thousands of dangerous killers, schooled in the methods of
murder, often supported by outlaw regimes, are now spread throughout the world
like ticking timebombs, set to go off without warning.

Thanks to the work of our law enforcement officials and coalition partners,
hundreds of terrorists have been arrested. Yet, tens of thousands of trained
terrorists are still at large. These enemies view the entire world as a
battlefield, and we must pursue them wherever they are. So long as training
camps operate, so long as nations harbor terrorists, freedom is at risk. And
America and our allies must not and will not allow it.

Our Nation will continue to be steadfast and patient and persistent in the
pursuit of two great objectives. First, we will shut down terrorist camps,
disrupt terrorist plans, and bring terrorists to justice. And second, we must
prevent the terrorists and regimes who seek chemical, biological, or nuclear
weapons from threatening the United States and the world.

Our military has put the terror training camps of Afghanistan out of business,
yet camps still exist in at least a dozen countries. A terrorist underworld,
including groups like Hamas, Hizballah, Islamic Jihad, Jaish-e-Mohammed,
operates in remote jungles and deserts and hides in the centers of large cities.

While the most visible military action is in Afghanistan, America is acting
elsewhere. We now have troops in the Philippines, helping to train that
country's armed forces to go after terrorist cells that have executed an
American and still hold hostages. Our soldiers, working with the Bosnian
Government, seized terrorists who were plotting to bomb our Embassy. Our Navy is
patrolling the coast of Africa to block the shipment of weapons and the
establishment of terrorist camps in Somalia.

My hope is that all nations will heed our call and eliminate the terrorist
parasites who threaten their countries and our own. Many nations are acting
forcefully. Pakistan is now cracking down on terror, and I admire the strong
leadership of President Musharraf. But some governments will be timid in the
face of terror. And make no mistake about it: If they do not act, America will.

Our second goal is to prevent regimes that sponsor terror from threatening
America or our friends and allies with weapons of mass destruction. Some of
these regimes have been pretty quiet since September the 11th, but we know their
true nature.

North Korea is a regime arming with missiles and weapons of mass destruction,
while starving its citizens.

Iran aggressively pursues these weapons and exports terror, while an unelected
few repress the Iranian people's hope for freedom.

Iraq continues to flaunt its hostility toward America and to support terror. The
Iraqi regime has plotted to develop anthrax and nerve gas and nuclear weapons
for over a decade. This is a regime that has already used poison gas to murder
thousands of its own citizens, leaving the bodies of mothers huddled over their
dead children. This is a regime that agreed to international inspections, then
kicked out the inspectors. This is a regime that has something to hide from the
civilized world.

States like these and their terrorist allies constitute an axis of evil, arming
to threaten the peace of the world. By seeking weapons of mass destruction,
these regimes pose a grave and growing danger. They could provide these arms to
terrorists, giving them the means to match their hatred. They could attack our
allies or attempt to blackmail the United States. In any of these cases, the
price of indifference would be catastrophic.

We will work closely with our coalition to deny terrorists and their state
sponsors the materials, technology, and expertise to make and deliver weapons of
mass destruction. We will develop and deploy effective missile defenses to
protect America and our allies from sudden attack. And all nations should know:
America will do what is necessary to ensure our Nation's security.

We'll be deliberate; yet, time is not on our side. I will not wait on events
while dangers gather. I will not stand by as peril draws closer and closer. The
United States of America will not permit the world's most dangerous regimes to
threaten us with the world's most destructive weapons.

Our war on terror is well begun, but it is only begun. This campaign may not be
finished on our watch; yet, it must be and it will be waged on our watch. We
can't stop short. If we stop now, leaving terror camps intact and terrorist
states unchecked, our sense of security would be false and temporary. History
has called America and our allies to action, and it is both our responsibility
and our privilege to fight freedom's fight.

Our first priority must always be the security of our Nation, and that will be
reflected in the budget I send to Congress. My budget supports three great goals
for America: We will win this war; we will protect our homeland; and we will
revive our economy.

September the 11th brought out the best in America and the best in this
Congress. And I join the American people in applauding your unity and resolve.
Now Americans deserve to have this same spirit directed toward addressing
problems here at home. I'm a proud member of my party. Yet as we act to win the
war, protect our people, and create jobs in America, we must act, first and
foremost, not as Republicans, not as Democrats but as Americans.

It costs a lot to fight this war. We have spent more than a billion dollars a
month, over $30 million a day, and we must be prepared for future operations.
Afghanistan proved that expensive precision weapons defeat the enemy and spare
innocent lives, and we need more of them. We need to replace aging aircraft and
make our military more agile to put our troops anywhere in the world quickly and
safely. Our men and women in uniform deserve the best weapons, the best
equipment, the best training, and they also deserve another pay raise.

My budget includes the largest increase in defense spending in two decades,
because while the price of freedom and security is high, it is never too high.
Whatever it costs to defend our country, we will pay.

The next priority of my budget is to do everything possible to protect our
citizens and strengthen our Nation against the ongoing threat of another attack.
Time and distance from the events of September the 11th will not make us safer
unless we act on its lessons. America is no longer protected by vast oceans. We
are protected from attack only by vigorous action abroad and increased vigilance
at home.

My budget nearly doubles funding for a sustained strategy of homeland security,
focused on four key areas: bioterrorism, emergency response, airport and border
security, and improved intelligence. We will develop vaccines to fight anthrax
and other deadly diseases. We'll increase funding to help States and communities
train and equip our heroic police and firefighters. We will improve intelligence
collection and sharing, expand patrols at our borders, strengthen the security
of air travel, and use technology to track the arrivals and departures of
visitors to the United States.

Homeland security will make America not only stronger but, in many ways, better.
Knowledge gained from bioterrorism research will improve public health. Stronger
police and fire departments will mean safer neighborhoods. Stricter border
enforcement will help combat illegal drugs. And as government works to better
secure our homeland, America will continue to depend on the eyes and ears of
alert citizens.

A few days before Christmas, an airline flight attendant spotted a passenger
lighting a match. The crew and passengers quickly subdued the man, who had been
trained by Al Qaida and was armed with explosives. The people on that plane were
alert and, as a result, likely saved nearly 200 lives. And tonight we welcome
and thank flight attendants Hermis Moutardier and Christina Jones.

Once we have funded our national security and our homeland security, the final
great priority of my budget is economic security for the American people. To
achieve these great national objectives--to win the war, protect the homeland,
and revitalize our economy--our budget will run a deficit that will be small and
short term, so long as Congress restrains spending and acts in a fiscally
responsible manner. We have clear priorities, and we must act at home with the
same purpose and resolve we have shown overseas. We'll prevail in the war, and
we will defeat this recession.

Americans who have lost their jobs need our help, and I support extending
unemployment benefits and direct assistance for health care coverage. Yet,
American workers want more than unemployment checks; they want a steady
paycheck. When America works, America prospers, so my economic security plan can
be summed up in one word: jobs.

Good jobs begin with good schools, and here we've made a fine start. Republicans
and Democrats worked together to achieve historic education reform so that no
child is left behind. I was proud to work with members of both parties: Chairman
John Boehner and Congressman George Miller; Senator Judd Gregg. And I was so
proud of our work, I even had nice things to say about my friend Ted Kennedy.
[Laughter] I know the folks at the Crawford coffee shop couldn't believe I'd say
such a thing-- [laughter]--but our work on this bill shows what is possible if
we set aside posturing and focus on results.

There is more to do. We need to prepare our children to read and succeed in
school with improved Head Start and early childhood development programs. We
must upgrade our teacher colleges and teacher training and launch a major
recruiting drive with a great goal for America, a quality teacher in every
classroom.

Good jobs also depend on reliable and affordable energy. This Congress must act
to encourage conservation, promote technology, build infrastructure, and it must
act to increase energy production at home so America is less dependent on
foreign oil.

Good jobs depend on expanded trade. Selling into new markets creates new jobs,
so I ask Congress to finally approve trade promotion authority.

On these two key issues, trade and energy, the House of Representatives has
acted to create jobs, and I urge the Senate to pass this legislation.

Good jobs depend on sound tax policy. Last year, some in this Hall thought my
tax relief plan was too small; some thought it was too big. But when the checks
arrived in the mail, most Americans thought tax relief was just about right.
Congress listened to the people and responded by reducing tax rates, doubling
the child credit, and ending the death tax. For the sake of long-term growth and
to help Americans plan for the future, let's make these tax cuts permanent.

The way out of this recession, the way to create jobs, is to grow the economy by
encouraging investment in factories and equipment and by speeding up tax relief
so people have more money to spend. For the sake of American workers, let's pass
a stimulus package.

Good jobs must be the aim of welfare reform. As we reauthorize these important
reforms, we must always remember the goal is to reduce dependency on government
and offer every American the dignity of a job.

Americans know economic security can vanish in an instant without health
security. I ask Congress to join me this year to enact a patients' bill of
rights, to give uninsured workers credits to help buy health coverage, to
approve an historic increase in the spending for veterans' health, and to give
seniors a sound and modern Medicare system that includes coverage for
prescription drugs.

A good job should lead to security in retirement. I ask Congress to enact new
safeguards for 401K and pension plans. Employees who have worked hard and saved
all their lives should not have to risk losing everything if their company
fails. Through stricter accounting standards and tougher disclosure
requirements, corporate America must be made more accountable to employees and
shareholders and held to the highest standards of conduct.

Retirement security also depends upon keeping the commitments of Social
Security, and we will. We must make Social Security financially stable and allow
personal retirement accounts for younger workers who choose them.

Members, you and I will work together in the months ahead on other issues:
productive farm policy; a cleaner environment; broader homeownership, especially
among minorities; and ways to encourage the good work of charities and
faith-based groups. I ask you to join me on these important domestic issues in
the same spirit of cooperation we've applied to our war against terrorism.

During these last few months, I've been humbled and privileged to see the true
character of this country in a time of testing. Our enemies believed America was
weak and materialistic, that we would splinter in fear and selfishness. They
were as wrong as they are evil.

The American people have responded magnificently, with courage and compassion,
strength and resolve. As I have met the heroes, hugged the families, and looked
into the tired faces of rescuers, I have stood in awe of the American people.

And I hope you will join me--I hope you will join me in expressing thanks to one
American for the strength and calm and comfort she brings to our Nation in
crisis, our First Lady, Laura Bush.

None of us would ever wish the evil that was done on September the 11th. Yet,
after America was attacked, it was as if our entire country looked into a mirror
and saw our better selves. We were reminded that we are citizens with
obligations to each other, to our country, and to history. We began to think
less of the goods we can accumulate and more about the good we can do.

For too long our culture has said, "If it feels good, do it." Now America is
embracing a new ethic and a new creed, "Let's roll." In the sacrifice of
soldiers, the fierce brotherhood of firefighters, and the bravery and generosity
of ordinary citizens, we have glimpsed what a new culture of responsibility
could look like. We want to be a nation that serves goals larger than self.
We've been offered a unique opportunity, and we must not let this moment pass.

My call tonight is for every American to commit at least 2 years, 4,000 hours
over the rest of your lifetime, to the service of your neighbors and your
Nation. Many are already serving, and I thank you. If you aren't sure how to
help, I've got a good place to start. To sustain and extend the best that has
emerged in America, I invite you to join the new USA Freedom Corps. The Freedom
Corps will focus on three areas of need: responding in case of crisis at home;
rebuilding our communities; and extending American compassion throughout the
world.

One purpose of the USA Freedom Corps will be homeland security. America needs
retired doctors and nurses who can be mobilized in major emergencies, volunteers
to help police and fire departments, transportation and utility workers
well-trained in spotting danger.

Our country also needs citizens working to rebuild our communities. We need
mentors to love children, especially children whose parents are in prison. And
we need more talented teachers in troubled schools. USA Freedom Corps will
expand and improve the good efforts of AmeriCorps and Senior Corps to recruit
more than 200,000 new volunteers.

And America needs citizens to extend the compassion of our country to every part
of the world. So we will renew the promise of the Peace Corps, double its
volunteers over the next 5 years, and ask it to join a new effort to encourage
development and education and opportunity in the Islamic world.

This time of adversity offers a unique moment of opportunity, a moment we must
seize to change our culture. Through the gathering momentum of millions of acts
of service and decency and kindness, I know we can overcome evil with greater
good.

And we have a great opportunity during this time of war to lead the world toward
the values that will bring lasting peace. All fathers and mothers, in all
societies, want their children to be educated and live free from poverty and
violence. No people on Earth yearn to be oppressed or aspire to servitude or
eagerly await the midnight knock of the secret police. If anyone doubts this,
let them look to Afghanistan, where the Islamic "street" greeted the fall of
tyranny with song and celebration. Let the skeptics look to Islam's own rich
history, with its centuries of learning and tolerance and progress. America will
lead by defending liberty and justice because they are right and true and
unchanging for all people everywhere.

No nation owns these aspirations, and no nation is exempt from them. We have no
intention of imposing our culture. But America will always stand firm for the
nonnegotiable demands of human dignity: the rule of law; limits on the power of
the state; respect for women; private property; free speech; equal justice; and
religious tolerance.

America will take the side of brave men and women who advocate these values
around the world, including the Islamic world, because we have a greater
objective than eliminating threats and containing resentment. We seek a just and
peaceful world beyond the war on terror.

In this moment of opportunity, a common danger is erasing old rivalries. America
is working with Russia and China and India, in ways we have never before, to
achieve peace and prosperity. In every region, free markets and free trade and
free societies are proving their power to lift lives. Together with friends and
allies from Europe to Asia and Africa to Latin America, we will demonstrate that
the forces of terror cannot stop the momentum of freedom.

The last time I spoke here, I expressed the hope that life would return to
normal. In some ways, it has. In others, it never will. Those of us who have
lived through these challenging times have been changed by them. We've come to
know truths that we will never question: Evil is real, and it must be opposed.
Beyond all differences of race or creed, we are one country, mourning together
and facing danger together. Deep in the American character, there is honor, and
it is stronger than cynicism. And many have discovered again that even in
tragedy--especially in tragedy--God is near.

In a single instant, we realized that this will be a decisive decade in the
history of liberty, that we've been called to a unique role in human events.
Rarely has the world faced a choice more clear or consequential.

Our enemies send other people's children on missions of suicide and murder. They
embrace tyranny and death as a cause and a creed. We stand for a different
choice, made long ago on the day of our founding. We affirm it again today. We
choose freedom and the dignity of every life.

Steadfast in our purpose, we now press on. We have known freedom's price. We
have shown freedom's power. And in this great conflict, my fellow Americans, we
will see freedom's victory.

Thank you all. May God bless.

2003:
Mr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, Members of Congress, distinguished citizens
and fellow citizens: Every year, by law and by custom, we meet here to consider
the state of the Union. This year, we gather in this Chamber deeply aware of
decisive days that lie ahead.

You and I serve our country in a time of great consequence. During this session
of Congress, we have the duty to reform domestic programs vital to our country.
We have the opportunity to save millions of lives abroad from a terrible
disease. We will work for a prosperity that is broadly shared, and we will
answer every danger and every enemy that threatens the American people.

In all these days of promise and days of reckoning, we can be confident. In a
whirlwind of change and hope and peril, our faith is sure; our resolve is firm;
and our Union is strong.

This country has many challenges. We will not deny, we will not ignore, we will
not pass along our problems to other Congresses, to other Presidents, and other
generations. We will confront them with focus and clarity and courage.

During the last 2 years, we have seen what can be accomplished when we work
together. To lift the standards of our public schools, we achieved historic
education reform, which must now be carried out in every school and in every
classroom so that every child in America can read and learn and succeed in life.
To protect our country, we reorganized our Government and created the Department
of Homeland Security, which is mobilizing against the threats of a new era. To
bring our economy out of recession, we delivered the largest tax relief in a
generation. To insist on integrity in American business, we passed tough
reforms, and we are holding corporate criminals to account.

Some might call this a good record. I call it a good start. Tonight I ask the
House and the Senate to join me in the next bold steps to serve our fellow
citizens.

Our first goal is clear: We must have an economy that grows fast enough to
employ every man and woman who seeks a job. After recession, terrorist attacks,
corporate scandals, and stock market declines, our economy is recovering. Yet,
it's not growing fast enough or strongly enough. With unemployment rising, our
Nation needs more small businesses to open, more companies to invest and expand,
more employers to put up the sign that says, "Help Wanted." Jobs are created
when the economy grows. The economy grows when Americans have more money to
spend and invest, and the best and fairest way to make sure Americans have that
money is not to tax it away in the first place.

I am proposing that all the income-tax reductions set for 2004 and 2006 be made
permanent and effective this year. And under my plan, as soon as I've signed the
bill, this extra money will start showing up in workers' paychecks. Instead of
gradually reducing the marriage penalty, we should do it now. Instead of slowly
raising the child credit to $1,000, we should send the checks to American
families now.

The tax relief is for everyone who pays income taxes, and it will help our
economy immediately: 92 million Americans will keep, this year, an average of
almost $1,100 more of their own money; a family of 4 with an income of $40,000
would see their Federal income taxes fall from $1,178 to $45 per year; our plan
will improve the bottom line for more than 23 million small businesses.

You, the Congress, have already passed all these reductions and promised them
for future years. If this tax relief is good for Americans 3, or 5, or 7 years
from now, it is even better for Americans today.

We should also strengthen the economy by treating investors equally in our tax
laws. It's fair to tax a company's profits. It is not fair to again tax the
shareholder on the same profits. To boost investor confidence and to help the
nearly 10 million seniors who receive dividend income, I ask you to end the
unfair double taxation of dividends.

Lower taxes and greater investment will help this economy expand. More jobs mean
more taxpayers and higher revenues to our Government. The best way to address
the deficit and move toward a balanced budget is to encourage economic growth
and to show some spending discipline in Washington, DC.

We must work together to fund only our most important priorities. I will send
you a budget that increases discretionary spending by 4 percent next year, about
as much as the average family's income is expected to grow. And that is a good
benchmark for us. Federal spending should not rise any faster than the paychecks
of American families.

A growing economy and a focus on essential priorities will be crucial to the
future of Social Security. As we continue to work together to keep Social
Security sound and reliable, we must offer younger workers a chance to invest in
retirement accounts that they will control and they will own.

Our second goal is high quality, affordable health for all Americans. The
American system of medicine is a model of skill and innovation, with a pace of
discovery that is adding good years to our lives. Yet for many people, medical
care costs too much, and many have no health coverage at all. These problems
will not be solved with a nationalized health care system that dictates coverage
and rations care.

Instead, we must work toward a system in which all Americans have a good
insurance policy, choose their own doctors, and seniors and low- income
Americans receive the help they need. Instead of bureaucrats and trial lawyers
and HMOs, we must put doctors and nurses and patients back in charge of American
medicine.

Health care reform must begin with Medicare. Medicare is the binding commitment
of a caring society. We must renew that commitment by giving seniors access to
preventive medicine and new drugs that are transforming health care in America.

Seniors happy with the current Medicare system should be able to keep their
coverage just the way it is. And just like you, the Members of Congress, and
your staffs and other Federal employees, all seniors should have the choice of a
health care plan that provides prescription drugs.

My budget will commit an additional $400 billion over the next decade to reform
and strengthen Medicare. Leaders of both political parties have talked for years
about strengthening Medicare. I urge the Members of this new Congress to act
this year.

To improve our health care system, we must address one of the prime causes of
higher cost, the constant threat that physicians and hospitals will be unfairly
sued. Because of excessive litigation, everybody pays more for health care, and
many parts of America are losing fine doctors. No one has ever been healed by a
frivolous lawsuit. I urge the Congress to pass medical liability reform.

Our third goal is to promote energy independence for our country, while
dramatically improving the environment. I have sent you a comprehensive energy
plan to promote energy efficiency and conservation, to develop cleaner
technology, and to produce more energy at home. I have sent you Clear Skies
legislation that mandates a 70-percent cut in air pollution from powerplants
over the next 15 years. I have sent you a Healthy Forests Initiative, to help
prevent the catastrophic fires that devastate communities, kill wildlife, and
burn away millions of acres of treasured forests.

I urge you to pass these measures, for the good of both our environment and our
economy. Even more, I ask you to take a crucial step and protect our environment
in ways that generations before us could not have imagined.

In this century, the greatest environmental progress will come about not through
endless lawsuits or command-and-control regulations but through technology and
innovation. Tonight I'm proposing $1.2 billion in research funding so that
America can lead the world in developing clean, hydrogen-powered automobiles.

A simple chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen generates energy, which
can be used to power a car, producing only water, not exhaust fumes. With a new
national commitment, our scientists and engineers will overcome obstacles to
taking these cars from laboratory to showroom, so that the first car driven by a
child born today could be powered by hydrogen and pollution-free. Join me in
this important innovation to make our air significantly cleaner and our country
much less dependent on foreign sources of energy.

Our fourth goal is to apply the compassion of America to the deepest problems of
America. For so many in our country, the homeless and the fatherless, the
addicted, the need is great. Yet there's power, wonder- working power, in the
goodness and idealism and faith of the American people.

Americans are doing the work of compassion every day, visiting prisoners,
providing shelter for battered women, bringing companionship to lonely seniors.
These good works deserve our praise. They deserve our personal support, and when
appropriate, they deserve the assistance of the Federal Government.

I urge you to pass both my Faith-Based Initiative and the Citizen Service Act,
to encourage acts of compassion that can transform America, one heart and one
soul at a time.

Last year, I called on my fellow citizens to participate in the USA Freedom
Corps, which is enlisting tens of thousands of new volunteers across America.
Tonight I ask Congress and the American people to focus the spirit of service
and the resources of Government on the needs of some of our most vulnerable
citizens, boys and girls trying to grow up without guidance and attention and
children who have to go through a prison gate to be hugged by their mom or dad.
I propose a $450 million initiative to bring mentors to more than a million
disadvantaged junior high students and children of prisoners. Government will
support the training and recruiting of mentors. Yet it is the men and women of
America who will fill the need. One mentor, one person can change a life
forever, and I urge you to be that one person.

Another cause of hopelessness is addiction to drugs. Addiction crowds out
friendship, ambition, moral conviction and reduces all the richness of life to a
single destructive desire. As a government, we are fighting illegal drugs by
cutting off supplies and reducing demand through antidrug education programs.
Yet for those already addicted, the fight against drugs is a fight for their own
lives. Too many Americans in search of treatment cannot get it. So tonight I
propose a new $600 million program to help an additional 300,000 Americans
receive treatment over the next 3 years.

Our Nation is blessed with recovery programs that do amazing work. One of them
is found at the Healing Place Church in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. A man in the
program said, "God does miracles in people's lives, and you never think it
could be you." Tonight let us bring to all Americans who struggle with drug
addiction this message of hope: The miracle of recovery is possible, and it
could be you.

By caring for children who need mentors and for addicted men and women who need
treatment, we are building a more welcoming society, a culture that values every
life. And in this work, we must not overlook the weakest among us. I ask you to
protect infants at the very hour of their birth and end the practice of
partial-birth abortion. And because no human life should be started or ended as
the object of an experiment, I ask you to set a high standard for humanity and
pass a law against all human cloning.

The qualities of courage and compassion that we strive for in America also
determine our conduct abroad. The American flag stands for more than our power
and our interests. Our Founders dedicated this country to the cause of human
dignity, the rights of every person, and the possibilities of every life. This
conviction leads us into the world to help the afflicted and defend the peace
and confound the designs of evil men.

In Afghanistan, we helped to liberate an oppressed people. And we will continue
helping them secure their country, rebuild their society, and educate all their
children, boys and girls. In the Middle East, we will continue to seek peace
between a secure Israel and a democratic Palestine. Across the Earth, America is
feeding the hungry. More than 60 percent of international food aid comes as a
gift from the people of the United States. As our Nation moves troops and builds
alliances to make our world safer, we must also remember our calling as a
blessed country is to make the world better.

Today, on the continent of Africa, nearly 30 million people have the AIDS virus,
including 3 million children under the age 15. There are whole countries in
Africa where more than one-third of the adult population carries the infection.
More than 4 million require immediate drug treatment. Yet across that continent,
only 50,000 AIDS victims-- only 50,000--are receiving the medicine they need.

Because the AIDS diagnosis is considered a death sentence, many do not seek
treatment. Almost all who do are turned away. A doctor in rural South Africa
describes his frustration. He says, "We have no medicines. Many hospitals tell
people, 'You've got AIDS. We can't help you. Go home and die.' " In an age of
miraculous medicines, no person should have to hear those words.

AIDS can be prevented. Antiretroviral drugs can extend life for many years. And
the cost of those drugs has dropped from $12,000 a year to under $300 a year,
which places a tremendous possibility within our grasp. Ladies and gentlemen,
seldom has history offered a greater opportunity to do so much for so many.

We have confronted and will continue to confront HIV/AIDS in our own country.
And to meet a severe and urgent crisis abroad, tonight I propose the Emergency
Plan for AIDS Relief, a work of mercy beyond all current international efforts
to help the people of Africa. This comprehensive plan will prevent 7 million new
AIDS infections, treat at least 2 million people with life-extending drugs, and
provide humane care for millions of people suffering from AIDS and for children
orphaned by AIDS. I ask the Congress to commit $15 billion over the next 5
years, including nearly $10 billion in new money, to turn the tide against AIDS
in the most afflicted nations of Africa and the Caribbean.

This Nation can lead the world in sparing innocent people from a plague of
nature. And this Nation is leading the world in confronting and defeating the
manmade evil of international terrorism.

There are days when our fellow citizens do not hear news about the war on
terror. There's never a day when I do not learn of another threat or receive
reports of operations in progress or give an order in this global war against a
scattered network of killers. The war goes on, and we are winning.

To date, we've arrested or otherwise dealt with many key commanders of Al Qaida.
They include a man who directed logistics and funding for the September the 11th
attacks, the chief of Al Qaida operations in the Persian Gulf who planned the
bombings of our embassies in east Africa and the U.S.S. Cole, an Al Qaida
operations chief from Southeast Asia, a former director of Al Qaida's training
camps in Afghanistan, a key Al Qaida operative in Europe, a major Al Qaida
leader in Yemen. All told, more than 3,000 suspected terrorists have been
arrested in many countries. Many others have met a different fate. Let's put it
this way: They are no longer a problem to the United States and our friends and
allies.

We are working closely with other nations to prevent further attacks. America
and coalition countries have uncovered and stopped terrorist conspiracies
targeting the Embassy in Yemen, the American Embassy in Singapore, a Saudi
military base, ships in the Straits of Hormuz and the Straits of Gibraltar.
We've broken Al Qaida cells in Hamburg, Milan, Madrid, London, Paris, as well as
Buffalo, New York.

We have the terrorists on the run. We're keeping them on the run. One by one,
the terrorists are learning the meaning of American justice.

As we fight this war, we will remember where it began: Here, in our own country.
This Government is taking unprecedented measures to protect our people and
defend our homeland. We've intensified security at the borders and ports of
entry, posted more than 50,000 newly trained Federal screeners in airports,
begun inoculating troops and first- responders against smallpox, and are
deploying the Nation's first early warning network of sensors to detect
biological attack. And this year, for the first time, we are beginning to field
a defense to protect this Nation against ballistic missiles.

I thank the Congress for supporting these measures. I ask you tonight to add to
our future security with a major research and production effort to guard our
people against bioterrorism, called Project BioShield. The budget I send you
will propose almost $6 billion to quickly make available effective vaccines and
treatments against agents like anthrax, botulinum toxin, Ebola, and plague. We
must assume that our enemies would use these diseases as weapons, and we must
act before the dangers are upon us.

Since September the 11th, our intelligence and law enforcement agencies have
worked more closely than ever to track and disrupt the terrorists. The FBI is
improving its ability to analyze intelligence and is transforming itself to meet
new threats. Tonight I am instructing the leaders of the FBI, the CIA, the
Homeland Security, and the Department of Defense to develop a Terrorist Threat
Integration Center, to merge and analyze all threat information in a single
location. Our Government must have the very best information possible, and we
will use it to make sure the right people are in the right places to protect all
our citizens.

Our war against terror is a contest of will in which perseverance is power. In
the ruins of two towers, at the western wall of the Pentagon, on a field in
Pennsylvania, this Nation made a pledge, and we renew that pledge tonight:
Whatever the duration of this struggle and whatever the difficulties, we will
not permit the triumph of violence in the affairs of men; free people will set
the course of history.

Today, the gravest danger in the war on terror, the gravest danger facing
America and the world, is outlaw regimes that seek and possess nuclear,
chemical, and biological weapons. These regimes could use such weapons for
blackmail, terror, and mass murder. They could also give or sell those weapons
to terrorist allies, who would use them without the least hesitation.

This threat is new. America's duty is familiar. Throughout the 20th century,
small groups of men seized control of great nations, built armies and arsenals,
and set out to dominate the weak and intimidate the world. In each case, their
ambitions of cruelty and murder had no limit. In each case, the ambitions of
Hitlerism, militarism, and communism were defeated by the will of free peoples,
by the strength of great alliances, and by the might of the United States of
America.

Now, in this century, the ideology of power and domination has appeared again
and seeks to gain the ultimate weapons of terror. Once again, this Nation and
all our friends are all that stand between a world at peace and a world of chaos
and constant alarm. Once again, we are called to defend the safety of our people
and the hopes of all mankind. And we accept this responsibility.

America is making a broad and determined effort to confront these dangers. We
have called on the United Nations to fulfill its charter and stand by its demand
that Iraq disarm. We're strongly supporting the International Atomic Energy
Agency in its mission to track and control nuclear materials around the world.
We're working with other governments to secure nuclear materials in the former
Soviet Union and to strengthen global treaties banning the production and
shipment of missile technologies and weapons of mass destruction.

In all these efforts, however, America's purpose is more than to follow a
process; it is to achieve a result, the end of terrible threats to the civilized
world. All free nations have a stake in preventing sudden and catastrophic
attacks. And we're asking them to join us, and many are doing so. Yet the course
of this Nation does not depend on the decisions of others. Whatever action is
required, whenever action is necessary, I will defend the freedom and security
of the American people.

Different threats require different strategies. In Iran, we continue to see a
Government that represses its people, pursues weapons of mass destruction, and
supports terror. We also see Iranian citizens risking intimidation and death as
they speak out for liberty and human rights and democracy. Iranians, like all
people, have a right to choose their own Government and determine their own
destiny, and the United States supports their aspirations to live in freedom.

On the Korean Peninsula, an oppressive regime rules a people living in fear and
starvation. Throughout the 1990s, the United States relied on a negotiated
framework to keep North Korea from gaining nuclear weapons. We now know that
that regime was deceiving the world and developing those weapons all along. And
today the North Korean regime is using its nuclear program to incite fear and
seek concessions. America and the world will not be blackmailed.

America is working with the countries of the region, South Korea, Japan, China,
and Russia, to find a peaceful solution and to show the North Korean Government
that nuclear weapons will bring only isolation, economic stagnation, and
continued hardship. The North Korean regime will find respect in the world and
revival for its people only when it turns away from its nuclear ambitions.

Our Nation and the world must learn the lessons of the Korean Peninsula and not
allow an even greater threat to rise up in Iraq. A brutal dictator, with a
history of reckless aggression, with ties to terrorism, with great potential
wealth, will not be permitted to dominate a vital region and threaten the United
States.

Twelve years ago, Saddam Hussein faced the prospect of being the last casualty
in a war he had started and lost. To spare himself, he agreed to disarm of all
weapons of mass destruction. For the next 12 years, he systematically violated
that agreement. He pursued chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons, even while
inspectors were in his country. Nothing to date has restrained him from his
pursuit of these weapons, not economic sanctions, not isolation from the
civilized world, not even cruise missile strikes on his military facilities.

Almost 3 months ago, the United Nations Security Council gave Saddam Hussein his
final chance to disarm. He has shown instead utter contempt for the United
Nations and for the opinion of the world. The 108 U.N. inspectors were sent to
conduct--were not sent to conduct a scavenger hunt for hidden materials across a
country the size of California. The job of the inspectors is to verify that
Iraq's regime is disarming. It is up to Iraq to show exactly where it is hiding
its banned weapons, lay those weapons out for the world to see, and destroy them
as directed. Nothing like this has happened.

The United Nations concluded in 1999 that Saddam Hussein had biological weapons
sufficient to produce over 25,000 liters of anthrax, enough doses to kill
several million people. He hasn't accounted for that material. He's given no
evidence that he has destroyed it. The United Nations concluded that Saddam
Hussein had materials sufficient to produce more than 38,000 liters of botulinum
toxin, enough to subject millions of people to death by respiratory failure. He
hasn't accounted for that material. He's given no evidence that he has destroyed
it. Our intelligence officials estimate that Saddam Hussein had the materials to
produce as much as 500 tons of sarin, mustard, and VX nerve agent. In such
quantities, these chemical agents could also kill untold thousands. He's not
accounted for these materials. He has given no evidence that he has destroyed
them. U.S. intelligence indicates that Saddam Hussein had upwards of 30,000
munitions capable of delivering chemical agents. Inspectors recently turned up
16 of them, despite Iraq's recent declaration denying their existence. Saddam
Hussein has not accounted for the remaining 29,984 of these prohibited
munitions. He's given no evidence that he has destroyed them.

From three Iraqi defectors we know that Iraq, in the late 1990s, had several
mobile biological weapons labs. These are designed to produce germ warfare
agents and can be moved from place to a place to evade inspectors. Saddam
Hussein has not disclosed these facilities. He's given no evidence that he has
destroyed them.

The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed in the 1990s that Saddam
Hussein had an advanced nuclear weapons development program, had a design for a
nuclear weapon, and was working on five different methods of enriching uranium
for a bomb. The British Government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently
sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa. Our intelligence sources
tell us that he has attempted to purchase high-strength aluminum tubes suitable
for nuclear weapons production. Saddam Hussein has not credibly explained these
activities. He clearly has much to hide.

The dictator of Iraq is not disarming. To the contrary, he is deceiving. From
intelligence sources we know, for instance, that thousands of Iraqi security
personnel are at work hiding documents and materials from the U.N. inspectors,
sanitizing inspection sites, and monitoring the inspectors themselves. Iraqi
officials accompany the inspectors in order to intimidate witnesses.

Iraq is blocking U-2 surveillance flights requested by the United Nations. Iraqi
intelligence officers are posing as the scientists inspectors are supposed to
interview. Real scientists have been coached by Iraqi officials on what to say.
Intelligence sources indicate that Saddam Hussein has ordered that scientists
who cooperate with U.N. inspectors in disarming Iraq will be killed, along with
their families.

Year after year, Saddam Hussein has gone to elaborate lengths, spent enormous
sums, taken great risks to build and keep weapons of mass destruction. But why?
The only possible explanation, the only possible use he could have for those
weapons, is to dominate, intimidate, or attack.

With nuclear arms or a full arsenal of chemical and biological weapons, Saddam
Hussein could resume his ambitions of conquest in the Middle East and create
deadly havoc in that region. And this Congress and the American people must
recognize another threat. Evidence from intelligence sources, secret
communications, and statements by people now in custody reveal that Saddam
Hussein aids and protects terrorists, including members of Al Qaida. Secretly
and without fingerprints, he could provide one of his hidden weapons to
terrorists or help them develop their own.

Before September the 11th, many in the world believed that Saddam Hussein could
be contained. But chemical agents, lethal viruses, and shadowy terrorist
networks are not easily contained. Imagine those 19 hijackers with other weapons
and other plans, this time armed by Saddam Hussein. It would take one vial, one
canister, one crate slipped into this country to bring a day of horror like none
we have ever known. We will do everything in our power to make sure that that
day never comes.

Some have said we must not act until the threat is imminent. Since when have
terrorists and tyrants announced their intentions, politely putting us on notice
before they strike? If this threat is permitted to fully and suddenly emerge,
all actions, all words, and all recriminations would come too late. Trusting in
the sanity and restraint of Saddam Hussein is not a strategy, and it is not an
option.

The dictator who is assembling the world's most dangerous weapons has already
used them on whole villages, leaving thousands of his own citizens dead, blind,
or disfigured. Iraqi refugees tell us how forced confessions are obtained, by
torturing children while their parents are made to watch. International human
rights groups have cataloged other methods used in the torture chambers of Iraq:
electric shock, burning with hot irons, dripping acid on the skin, mutilation
with electric drills, cutting out tongues, and rape. If this is not evil, then
evil has no meaning.

And tonight I have a message for the brave and oppressed people of Iraq: Your
enemy is not surrounding your country; your enemy is ruling your country. And
the day he and his regime are removed from power will be the day of your
liberation.

The world has waited 12 years for Iraq to disarm. America will not accept a
serious and mounting threat to our country and our friends and our allies. The
United States will ask the U.N. Security Council to convene on February the 5th
to consider the facts of Iraq's ongoing defiance of the world. Secretary of
State Powell will present information and intelligence about Iraqi's
legal--Iraq's illegal weapons programs, its attempt to hide those weapons from
inspectors, and its links to terrorist groups.

We will consult. But let there be no misunderstanding: If Saddam Hussein does
not fully disarm, for the safety of our people and for the peace of the world,
we will lead a coalition to disarm him.

Tonight I have a message for the men and women who will keep the peace, members
of the American Armed Forces: Many of you are assembling in or near the Middle
East, and some crucial hours may lay ahead. In those hours, the success of our
cause will depend on you. Your training has prepared you. Your honor will guide
you. You believe in America, and America believes in you.

Sending Americans into battle is the most profound decision a President can
make. The technologies of war have changed; the risks and suffering of war have
not. For the brave Americans who bear the risk, no victory is free from sorrow.
This Nation fights reluctantly, because we know the cost and we dread the days
of mourning that always come.

We seek peace. We strive for peace. And sometimes peace must be defended. A
future lived at the mercy of terrible threats is no peace at all. If war is
forced upon us, we will fight in a just cause and by just means, sparing, in
every way we can, the innocent. And if war is forced upon us, we will fight with
the full force and might of the United States military, and we will prevail.

And as we and our coalition partners are doing in Afghanistan, we will bring to
the Iraqi people food and medicines and supplies and freedom.

Many challenges, abroad and at home, have arrived in a single season. In 2
years, America has gone from a sense of invulnerability to an awareness of
peril, from bitter division in small matters to calm unity in great causes. And
we go forward with confidence, because this call of history has come to the
right country.

Americans are a resolute people who have risen to every test of our time.
Adversity has revealed the character of our country, to the world and to
ourselves. America is a strong nation and honorable in the use of our strength.
We exercise power without conquest, and we sacrifice for the liberty of
strangers.

Americans are a free people, who know that freedom is the right of every person
and the future of every nation. The liberty we prize is not America's gift to
the world, it is God's gift to humanity.

We Americans have faith in ourselves, but not in ourselves alone. We do not
know--we do not claim to know all the ways of providence, yet we can trust in
them, placing our confidence in the loving God behind all of life and all of
history.

May He guide us now. And may God continue to bless the United States of America.

2004:
Mr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, Members of Congress, distinguished guests,
and fellow citizens: America this evening is a nation called to great
responsibilities, and we are rising to meet them.

As we gather tonight, hundreds of thousands of American service men and women
are deployed across the world in the war on terror. By bringing hope to the
oppressed and delivering justice to the violent, they are making America more
secure.

Each day, law enforcement personnel and intelligence officers are tracking
terrorist threats; analysts are examining airline passenger lists; the men and
women of our new Homeland Security Department are patrolling our coasts and
borders. And their vigilance is protecting America.

Americans are proving once again to be the hardest working people in the world.
The American economy is growing stronger. The tax relief you passed is working.

Tonight Members of Congress can take pride in the great works of compassion and
reform that skeptics had thought impossible. You're raising the standards for
our public schools, and you are giving our senior citizens prescription drug
coverage under Medicare.

We have faced serious challenges together, and now we face a choice: We can go
forward with confidence and resolve, or we can turn back to the dangerous
illusion that terrorists are not plotting and outlaw regimes are no threat to
us. We can press on with economic growth and reforms in education and Medicare,
or we can turn back to old policies and old divisions.

We've not come all this way, through tragedy and trial and war, only to falter
and leave our work unfinished. Americans are rising to the tasks of history, and
they expect the same from us. In their efforts, their enterprise, and their
character, the American people are showing that the state of our Union is
confident and strong.

Our greatest responsibility is the active defense of the American people.
Twenty-eight months have passed since September the 11th, 2001-- over 2 years
without an attack on American soil. And it is tempting to believe that the
danger is behind us. That hope is understandable, comforting--and false. The
killing has continued in Bali, Jakarta, Casablanca, Riyadh, Mombasa, Jerusalem,
Istanbul, and Baghdad. The terrorists continue to plot against America and the
civilized world. And by our will and courage, this danger will be defeated.

Inside the United States, where the war began, we must continue to give our
homeland security and law enforcement personnel every tool they need to defend
us. And one of those essential tools is the PATRIOT Act, which allows Federal
law enforcement to better share information to track terrorists, to disrupt
their cells, and to seize their assets. For years, we have used similar
provisions to catch embezzlers and drug traffickers. If these methods are good
for hunting criminals, they are even more important for hunting terrorists.

Key provisions of the PATRIOT Act are set to expire next year. The terrorist
threat will not expire on that schedule. Our law enforcement needs this vital
legislation to protect our citizens. You need to renew the PATRIOT Act.

America is on the offensive against the terrorists who started this war. Last
March, Khalid Sheik Mohammed, a mastermind of September the 11th, awoke to find
himself in the custody of U.S. and Pakistani authorities. Last August the 11th
brought the capture of the terrorist Hambali, who was a key player in the attack
in Indonesia that killed over 200 people. We're tracking Al Qaida around the
world, and nearly two-thirds of their known leaders have now been captured or
killed. Thousands of very skilled and determined military personnel are on the
manhunt, going after the remaining killers who hide in cities and caves, and one
by one, we will bring these terrorists to justice.

As part of the offensive against terror, we are also confronting the regimes
that harbor and support terrorists and could supply them with nuclear, chemical,
or biological weapons. The United States and our allies are determined: We
refuse to live in the shadow of this ultimate danger.

The first to see our determination were the Taliban, who made Afghanistan the
primary training base of Al Qaida killers. As of this month, that country has a
new constitution guaranteeing free elections and full participation by women.
Businesses are opening. Health care centers are being established, and the boys
and girls of Afghanistan are back in school. With the help from the new Afghan
army, our coalition is leading aggressive raids against the surviving members of
the Taliban and Al Qaida. The men and women of Afghanistan are building a nation
that is free and proud and fighting terror, and America is honored to be their
friend.

Since we last met in this Chamber, combat forces of the United States, Great
Britain, Australia, Poland, and other countries enforced the demands of the
United Nations, ended the rule of Saddam Hussein, and the people of Iraq are
free.

Having broken the Ba'athist regime, we face a remnant of violent Saddam
supporters. Men who ran away from our troops in battle are now dispersed and
attack from the shadows. These killers, joined by foreign terrorists, are a
serious, continuing danger. Yet we're making progress against them. The once
all-powerful ruler of Iraq was found in a hole and now sits in a prison cell. Of
the top 55 officials of the former regime, we have captured or killed 45. Our
forces are on the offensive, leading over 1,600 patrols a day and conducting an
average of 180 raids a week. We are dealing with these thugs in Iraq just as
surely as we dealt with Saddam Hussein's evil regime.

The work of building a new Iraq is hard, and it is right. And America has always
been willing to do what it takes for what is right. Last January, Iraq's only
law was the whim of one brutal man. Today, our coalition is working with the
Iraqi Governing Council to draft a basic law with a bill of rights. We're
working with Iraqis and the United Nations to prepare for a transition to full
Iraqi sovereignty by the end of June.

As democracy takes hold in Iraq, the enemies of freedom will do all in their
power to spread violence and fear. They are trying to shake the will of our
country and our friends, but the United States of America will never be
intimidated by thugs and assassins. The killers will fail, and the Iraqi people
will live in freedom.

Month by month, Iraqis are assuming more responsibility for their own security
and their own future. And tonight we are honored to welcome one of Iraq's most
respected leaders, the current President of the Iraqi Governing Council, Adnan
Pachachi.

Sir, America stands with you and the Iraqi people as you build a free and
peaceful nation.

Because of American leadership and resolve, the world is changing for the
better. Last month, the leader of Libya voluntarily pledged to disclose and
dismantle all of his regime's weapons of mass destruction programs, including a
uranium enrichment project for nuclear weapons. Colonel Qadhafi correctly judged
that his country would be better off and far more secure without weapons of mass
murder.

Nine months of intense negotiations involving the United States and Great
Britain succeeded with Libya, while 12 years of diplomacy with Iraq did not. And
one reason is clear: For diplomacy to be effective, words must be credible, and
no one can now doubt the word of America.

Different threats require different strategies. Along with nations in the
region, we're insisting that North Korea eliminate its nuclear program. America
and the international community are demanding that Iran meet its commitments and
not develop nuclear weapons. America is committed to keeping the world's most
dangerous weapons out of the hands of the most dangerous regimes.

When I came to this rostrum on September the 20th, 2001, I brought the police
shield of a fallen officer, my reminder of lives that ended and a task that does
not end. I gave to you and to all Americans my complete commitment to securing
our country and defeating our enemies. And this pledge, given by one, has been
kept by many.

You in the Congress have provided the resources for our defense and cast the
difficult votes of war and peace. Our closest allies have been unwavering.
America's intelligence personnel and diplomats have been skilled and tireless.
And the men and women of the American military-- they have taken the hardest
duty. We've seen their skill and their courage in armored charges and midnight
raids and lonely hours on faithful watch. We have seen the joy when they return
and felt the sorrow when one is lost. I've had the honor of meeting our service
men and women at many posts, from the deck of a carrier in the Pacific to a mess
hall in Baghdad.

Many of our troops are listening tonight, and I want you and your families to
know: America is proud of you. And my administration and this Congress will give
you the resources you need to fight and win the war on terror.

I know that some people question if America is really in a war at all. They view
terrorism more as a crime, a problem to be solved mainly with law enforcement
and indictments. After the World Trade Center was first attacked in 1993, some
of the guilty were indicted and tried and convicted and sent to prison. But the
matter was not settled. The terrorists were still training and plotting in other
nations and drawing up more ambitious plans. After the chaos and carnage of
September the 11th, it is not enough to serve our enemies with legal papers. The
terrorists and their supporters declared war on the United States, and war is
what they got.

Some in this Chamber and in our country did not support the liberation of Iraq.
Objections to war often come from principled motives, but let us be candid about
the consequences of leaving Saddam Hussein in power. We're seeking all the
facts. Already, the Kay Report identified dozens of
weapons-of-mass-destruction-related program activities and significant amounts
of equipment that Iraq concealed from the United Nations. Had we failed to act,
the dictator's weapons of mass destruction programs would continue to this day.
Had we failed to act, Security Council resolutions on Iraq would have been
revealed as empty threats, weakening the United Nations and encouraging defiance
by dictators around the world. Iraq's torture chambers would still be filled
with victims, terrified and innocent. The killing fields of Iraq, where hundreds
of thousands of men and women and children vanished into the sands, would still
be known only to the killers. For all who love freedom and peace, the world
without Saddam Hussein's regime is a better and safer place.

Some critics have said our duties in Iraq must be internationalized. This
particular criticism is hard to explain to our partners in Britain, Australia,
Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Thailand, Italy, Spain, Poland, Denmark,
Hungary, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Romania, the Netherlands, Norway, El Salvador, and
the 17 other countries that have committed troops to Iraq. As we debate at home,
we must never ignore the vital contributions of our international partners or
dismiss their sacrifices.

From the beginning, America has sought international support for our operations
in Afghanistan and Iraq, and we have gained much support. There is a difference,
however, between leading a coalition of many nations and submitting to the
objections of a few. America will never seek a permission slip to defend the
security of our country.

We also hear doubts that democracy is a realistic goal for the greater Middle
East, where freedom is rare. Yet it is mistaken and condescending to assume that
whole cultures and great religions are incompatible with liberty and
self-government. I believe that God has planted in every human heart the desire
to live in freedom. And even when that desire is crushed by tyranny for decades,
it will rise again.

As long as the Middle East remains a place of tyranny and despair and anger, it
will continue to produce men and movements that threaten the safety of America
and our friends. So America is pursuing a forward strategy of freedom in the
greater Middle East. We will challenge the enemies of reform, confront the
allies of terror, and expect a higher standard from our friend. To cut through
the barriers of hateful propaganda, the Voice of America and other broadcast
services are expanding their programming in Arabic and Persian, and soon a new
television service will begin providing reliable news and information across the
region. I will send you a proposal to double the budget of the National
Endowment for Democracy and to focus its new work on the development of free
elections and free markets, free press, and free labor unions in the Middle
East. And above all, we will finish the historic work of democracy in
Afghanistan and Iraq so those nations can light the way for others and help
transform a troubled part of the world.

America is a nation with a mission, and that mission comes from our most basic
beliefs. We have no desire to dominate, no ambitions of empire. Our aim is a
democratic peace, a peace founded upon the dignity and rights of every man and
woman. America acts in this cause with friends and allies at our side, yet we
understand our special calling: This great Republic will lead the cause of
freedom.

In the last 3 years, adversity has also revealed the fundamental strengths of
the American economy. We have come through recession and terrorist attack and
corporate scandals and the uncertainties of war. And because you acted to
stimulate our economy with tax relief, this economy is strong and growing
stronger.

You have doubled the child tax credit from 500 to $1,000, reduced the marriage
penalty, begun to phase out the death tax, reduced taxes on capital gains and
stock dividends, cut taxes on small businesses, and you have lowered taxes for
every American who pays income taxes.

Americans took those dollars and put them to work, driving this economy forward.
The pace of economic growth in the third quarter of 2003 was the fastest in
nearly 20 years; new home construction, the highest in almost 20 years;
homeownership rates, the highest ever. Manufacturing activity is increasing.
Inflation is low. Interest rates are low. Exports are growing. Productivity is
high, and jobs are on the rise. These numbers confirm that the American people
are using their money far better than Government would have, and you were right
to return it.

America's growing economy is also a changing economy. As technology transforms
the way almost every job is done, America becomes more productive, and workers
need new skills. Much of our job growth will be found in high-skilled fields
like health care and biotechnology. So we must respond by helping more Americans
gain the skills to find good jobs in our new economy.

All skills begin with the basics of reading and math, which are supposed to be
learned in the early grades of our schools. Yet for too long, for too many
children, those skills were never mastered. By passing the No Child Left Behind
Act, you have made the expectation of literacy the law of our country. We're
providing more funding for our schools, a 36-percent increase since 2001. We're
requiring higher standards. We are regularly testing every child on the
fundamentals. We are reporting results to parents and making sure they have
better options when schools are not performing. We are making progress toward
excellence for every child in America.

But the status quo always has defenders. Some want to undermine the No Child
Left Behind Act by weakening standards and accountability. Yet the results we
require are really a matter of common sense: We expect third graders to read and
do math at the third grade level, and that's not asking too much. Testing is the
only way to identify and help students who are falling behind. This Nation will
not go back to the days of simply shuffling children along from grade to grade
without them learning the basics. I refuse to give up on any child, and the No
Child Left Behind Act is opening the door of opportunity to all of America's
children.

At the same time, we must ensure that older students and adults can gain the
skills they need to find work now. Many of the fastest growing occupations
require strong math and science preparation and training beyond the high school
level. So tonight, I propose a series of measures called Jobs for the 21st
Century. This program will provide extra help to middle and high school students
who fall behind in reading and math, expand advanced placement programs in
low-income schools, invite math and science professionals from the private
sector to teach part-time in our high schools. I propose larger Pell grants for
students who prepare for college with demanding courses in high school. I
propose increasing our support for America's fine community colleges, so they
can--I do so, so they can train workers for industries that are creating the
most new jobs. By all these actions, we'll help more and more Americans to join
in the growing prosperity of our country. Job training is important, and so is
job creation. We must continue to pursue an aggressive, progrowth economic
agenda.

Congress has some unfinished business on the issue of taxes. The tax reductions
you passed are set to expire. Unless you act, the unfair tax on marriage will go
back up. Unless you act, millions of families will be charged $300 more in
Federal taxes for every child. Unless you act, small businesses will pay higher
taxes. Unless you act, the death tax will eventually come back to life. Unless
you act, Americans face a tax increase. What Congress has given, the Congress
should not take away. For the sake of job growth, the tax cuts you passed should
be permanent.

Our agenda for jobs and growth must help small-business owners and employees
with relief from needless Federal regulation and protect them from junk and
frivolous lawsuits.

Consumers and businesses need reliable supplies of energy to make our economy
run, so I urge you to pass legislation to modernize our electricity system,
promote conservation, and make America less dependent on foreign sources of
energy.

My administration is promoting free and fair trade to open up new markets for
America's entrepreneurs and manufacturers and farmers, to create jobs for
American workers. Younger workers should have the opportunity to build a nest
egg by saving part of their Social Security taxes in a personal retirement
account. We should make the Social Security system a source of ownership for the
American people. And we should limit the burden of Government on this economy by
acting as good stewards of taxpayers' dollars.

In 2 weeks, I will send you a budget that funds the war, protects the homeland,
and meets important domestic needs while limiting the growth in discretionary
spending to less than 4 percent. This will require that Congress focus on
priorities, cut wasteful spending, and be wise with the people's money. By doing
so, we can cut the deficit in half over the next 5 years.

Tonight I also ask you to reform our immigration laws so they reflect our values
and benefit our economy. I propose a new temporary- worker program to match
willing foreign workers with willing employers when no Americans can be found to
fill the job. This reform will be good for our economy because employers will
find needed workers in an honest and orderly system. A temporary-worker program
will help protect our homeland, allowing Border Patrol and law enforcement to
focus on true threats to our national security.

I oppose amnesty, because it would encourage further illegal immigration and
unfairly reward those who break our laws. My temporary- worker program will
preserve the citizenship path for those who respect the law while bringing
millions of hard-working men and women out from the shadows of American life.

Our Nation's health care system, like our economy, is also in a time of change.
Amazing medical technologies are improving and saving lives. This dramatic
progress has brought its own challenge, in the rising costs of medical care and
health insurance. Members of Congress, we must work together to help control
those costs and extend the benefits of modern medicine throughout our country.

Meeting these goals requires bipartisan effort, and 2 months ago, you showed the
way. By strengthening Medicare and adding a prescription drug benefit, you kept
a basic commitment to our seniors. You are giving them the modern medicine they
deserve.

Starting this year, under the law you passed, seniors can choose to receive a
drug discount card, saving them 10 to 25 percent off the retail price of most
prescription drugs, and millions of low-income seniors can get an additional
$600 to buy medicine. Beginning next year, seniors will have new coverage for
preventive screenings against diabetes and heart disease, and seniors just
entering Medicare can receive wellness exams.

In January of 2006, seniors can get prescription drug coverage under Medicare.
For a monthly premium of about $35, most seniors who do not have that coverage
today can expect to see their drug bills cut roughly in half. Under this reform,
senior citizens will be able to keep their Medicare just as it is, or they can
choose a Medicare plan that fits them best, just as you, as Members of Congress,
can choose an insurance plan that meets your needs. And starting this year,
millions of Americans will be able to save money tax-free for their medical
expenses in a health savings account.

I signed this measure proudly, and any attempt to limit the choices of our
seniors or to take away their prescription drug coverage under Medicare will
meet my veto.

On the critical issue of health care, our goal is to ensure that Americans can
choose and afford private health care coverage that best fits their individual
needs. To make insurance more affordable, Congress must act to address rapidly
rising health care costs. Small businesses should be able to band together and
negotiate for lower insurance rates, so they can cover more workers with health
insurance. I urge you to pass association health plans. I ask you to give lower
income Americans a refundable tax credit that would allow millions to buy their
own basic health insurance.

By computerizing health records, we can avoid dangerous medical mistakes, reduce
costs, and improve care. To protect the doctor-patient relationship and keep
good doctors doing good work, we must eliminate wasteful and frivolous medical
lawsuits. And tonight I propose that individuals who buy catastrophic health
care coverage as part of our new health savings accounts be allowed to deduct
100 percent of the premiums from their taxes.

A Government-run health care system is the wrong prescription. By keeping costs
under control, expanding access, and helping more Americans afford coverage, we
will preserve the system of private medicine that makes America's health care
the best in the world.

We are living in a time of great change in our world, in our economy, in science
and medicine. Yet some things endure: courage and compassion, reverence and
integrity, respect for differences of faith and race. The values we try to live
by never change, and they are instilled in us by fundamental institutions such
as families and schools and religious congregations. These institutions, these
unseen pillars of civilization, must remain strong in America, and we will
defend them. We must stand with our families to help them raise healthy,
responsible children. When it comes to helping children make right choices,
there is work for all of us to do.

One of the worst decisions our children can make is to gamble their lives and
futures on drugs. Our Government is helping parents confront this problem with
aggressive education, treatment, and law enforcement. Drug use in high school
has declined by 11 percent over the last 2 years. Four hundred thousand fewer
young people are using illegal drugs than in the year 2001. In my budget, I
propose new funding to continue our aggressive, community-based strategy to
reduce demand for illegal drugs. Drug testing in our schools has proven to be an
effective part of this effort. So tonight I propose an additional 23 million for
schools that want to use drug testing as a tool to save children's lives. The
aim here is not to punish children but to send them this message: We love you,
and we do not want to lose you.

To help children make right choices, they need good examples. Athletics play
such an important role in our society, but unfortunately, some in professional
sports are not setting much of an example. The use of performance-enhancing
drugs like steroids in baseball, football, and other sports is dangerous, and it
sends the wrong message, that there are shortcuts to accomplishment and that
performance is more important than character. So tonight I call on team owners,
union representatives, coaches, and players to take the lead, to send the right
signal, to get tough, and to get rid of steroids now.

To encourage right choices, we must be willing to confront the dangers young
people face, even when they're difficult to talk about. Each year, about 3
million teenagers contract sexually transmitted diseases that can harm them or
kill them or prevent them from ever becoming parents. In my budget, I propose a
grassroots campaign to help inform families about these medical risks. We will
double Federal funding for abstinence programs, so schools can teach this fact
of life: Abstinence for young people is the only certain way to avoid sexually
transmitted diseases.

Decisions children now make can affect their health and character for the rest
of their lives. All of us, parents and schools and government, must work
together to counter the negative influence of the culture and to send the right
messages to our children.

A strong America must also value the institution of marriage. I believe we
should respect individuals as we take a principled stand for one of the most
fundamental, enduring institutions of our civilization. Congress has already
taken a stand on this issue by passing the Defense of Marriage Act, signed in
1996 by President Clinton. That statute protects marriage under Federal law as a
union of a man and a woman and declares that one State may not redefine marriage
for other States.

Activist judges, however, have begun redefining marriage by court order, without
regard for the will of the people and their elected representatives. On an issue
of such great consequence, the people's voice must be heard. If judges insist on
forcing their arbitrary will upon the people, the only alternative left to the
people would be the constitutional process. Our Nation must defend the sanctity
of marriage.

The outcome of this debate is important, and so is the way we conduct it. The
same moral tradition that defines marriage also teaches that each individual has
dignity and value in God's sight.

It's also important to strengthen our communities by unleashing the compassion
of America's religious institutions. Religious charities of every creed are
doing some of the most vital work in our country: mentoring children, feeding
the hungry, taking the hand of the lonely. Yet Government has often denied
social service grants and contracts to these groups, just because they have a
cross or a Star of David or a crescent on the wall.

By Executive order, I have opened billions of dollars in grant money to
competition that includes faith-based charities. Tonight I ask you to codify
this into law, so people of faith can know that the law will never discriminate
against them again.

In the past, we've worked together to bring mentors to children of prisoners and
provide treatment for the addicted and help for the homeless. Tonight I ask you
to consider another group of Americans in need of help. This year, some 600,000
inmates will be released from prison back into society. We know from long
experience that if they can't find work or a home or help, they are much more
likely to commit crime and return to prison. So tonight I propose a 4-year, $300
million prisoner reentry initiative to expand job training and placement
services, to provide transitional housing, and to help newly released prisoners
get mentoring, including from faith-based groups. America is the land of second
chance, and when the gates of the prison open, the path ahead should lead to a
better life.

For all Americans, the last 3 years have brought tests we did not ask for and
achievements shared by all. By our actions, we have shown what kind of nation we
are. In grief, we have found the grace to go on. In challenge, we rediscovered
the courage and daring of a free people. In victory, we have shown the noble
aims and good heart of America. And having come this far, we sense that we live
in a time set apart.

I've been witness to the character of the people of America, who have shown calm
in times of danger, compassion for one another, and toughness for the long haul.
All of us have been partners in a great enterprise. And even some of the
youngest understand that we are living in historic times. Last month a girl in
Lincoln, Rhode Island, sent me a letter. It began, "Dear George W. Bush. If
there's anything you know I, Ashley Pearson, age 10, can do to help anyone,
please send me a letter and tell me what I can do to save our country." She
added this P.S.: "If you can send a letter to the troops, please put, 'Ashley
Pearson believes in you.' " Tonight, Ashley, your message to our troops has
just been conveyed. And yes, you have some duties yourself: Study hard in
school; listen to your mom or dad; help someone in need; and when you and your
friends see a man or woman in uniform, say, "Thank you." And Ashley, while you
do your part, all of us here in this great Chamber will do our best to keep you
and the rest of America safe and free.

My fellow citizens, we now move forward with confidence and faith. Our Nation is
strong and steadfast. The cause we serve is right, because it is the cause of
all mankind. The momentum of freedom in our world is unmistakable, and it is not
carried forward by our power alone. We can trust in that greater power who
guides the unfolding of the years. And in all that is to come, we can know that
His purposes are just and true.

May God continue to bless America.

2005:
Mr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, Members of Congress, fellow citizens:

As a new Congress gathers, all of us in the elected branches of Government share
a great privilege: We've been placed in office by the votes of the people we
serve. And tonight that is a privilege we share with newly elected leaders of
Afghanistan, the Palestinian Territories, Ukraine, and a free and sovereign
Iraq.

Two weeks ago, I stood on the steps of this Capitol and renewed the commitment
of our Nation to the guiding ideal of liberty for all. This evening I will set
forth policies to advance that ideal at home and around the world.

Tonight, with a healthy, growing economy, with more Americans going back to
work, with our Nation an active force for good in the world, the state of our
Union is confident and strong.

Our generation has been blessed by the expansion of opportunity, by advances in
medicine, by the security purchased by our parents' sacrifice. Now, as we see a
little gray in the mirror--or a lot of gray--[laughter]--and we watch our
children moving into adulthood, we ask the question: What will be the state of
their Union? Members of Congress, the choices we make together will answer that
question. Over the next several months, on issue after issue, let us do what
Americans have always done and build a better world for our children and our
grandchildren.

First, we must be good stewards of this economy and renew the great institutions
on which millions of our fellow citizens rely. America's economy is the fastest
growing of any major industrialized nation. In the past 4 years, we've provided
tax relief to every person who pays income taxes, overcome a recession, opened
up new markets abroad, prosecuted corporate criminals, raised homeownership to
its highest level in history. And in the last year alone, the United States has
added 2.3 million new jobs. When action was needed, the Congress delivered, and
the Nation is grateful.

Now we must add to these achievements. By making our economy more flexible, more
innovative, and more competitive, we will keep America the economic leader of
the world.

America's prosperity requires restraining the spending appetite of the Federal
Government. I welcome the bipartisan enthusiasm for spending discipline. I will
send you a budget that holds the growth of discretionary spending below
inflation, makes tax relief permanent, and stays on track to cut the deficit in
half by 2009. My budget substantially reduces or eliminates more than 150
Government programs that are not getting results or duplicate current efforts or
do not fulfill essential priorities. The principle here is clear: Taxpayer
dollars must be spent wisely or not at all.

To make our economy stronger and more dynamic, we must prepare a rising
generation to fill the jobs of the 21st century. Under the No Child Left Behind
Act, standards are higher, test scores are on the rise, and we're closing the
achievement gap for minority students. Now we must demand better results from
our high schools, so every high school diploma is a ticket to success. We will
help an additional 200,000 workers to get training for a better career by
reforming our job training system and strengthening America's community
colleges. And we'll make it easier for Americans to afford a college education
by increasing the size of Pell grants.

To make our economy stronger and more competitive, America must reward, not
punish, the efforts and dreams of entrepreneurs. Small business is the path of
advancement, especially for women and minorities, so we must free small
businesses from needless regulation and protect honest job-creators from junk
lawsuits. Justice is distorted and our economy is held back by irresponsible
class actions and frivolous asbestos claims, and I urge Congress to pass legal
reforms this year.

To make our economy stronger and more productive, we must make health care more
affordable and give families greater access to good coverage and more control
over their health decisions. I ask Congress to move forward on a comprehensive
health care agenda with tax credits to help low-income workers buy insurance, a
community health center in every poor county, improved information technology to
prevent medical error and needless costs, association health plans for small
businesses and their employees, expanded health savings accounts, and medical
liability reform that will reduce health care costs and make sure patients have
the doctors and care they need.

To keep our economy growing, we also need reliable supplies of affordable,
environmentally responsible energy. Nearly 4 years ago, I submitted a
comprehensive energy strategy that encourages conservation, alternative sources,
a modernized electricity grid, and more production here at home, including safe,
clean nuclear energy. My Clear Skies legislation will cut powerplant pollution
and improve the health of our citizens. And my budget provides strong funding
for leading-edge technology, from hydrogen-fueled cars to clean coal to
renewable sources such as ethanol. Four years of debate is enough. I urge
Congress to pass legislation that makes America more secure and less dependent
on foreign energy.

All these proposals are essential to expand this economy and add new jobs, but
they are just the beginning of our duty. To build the prosperity of future
generations, we must update institutions that were created to meet the needs of
an earlier time. Year after year, Americans are burdened by an archaic,
incoherent Federal Tax Code. I've appointed a bipartisan panel to examine the
Tax Code from top to bottom. And when their recommendations are delivered, you
and I will work together to give this Nation a Tax Code that is progrowth, easy
to understand, and fair to all.

America's immigration system is also outdated, unsuited to the needs of our
economy and to the values of our country. We should not be content with laws
that punish hardworking people who want only to provide for their families and
deny businesses willing workers and invite chaos at our border. It is time for
an immigration policy that permits temporary guest workers to fill jobs
Americans will not take, that rejects amnesty, that tells us who is entering and
leaving our country, and that closes the border to drug dealers and terrorists.

One of America's most important institutions, a symbol of the trust between
generations, is also in need of wise and effective reform. Social Security was a
great moral success of the 20th century, and we must honor its great purposes in
this new century. The system, however, on its current path, is headed toward
bankruptcy. And so we must join together to strengthen and save Social Security.

Today, more than 45 million Americans receive Social Security benefits, and
millions more are nearing retirement. And for them the system is sound and
fiscally strong. I have a message for every American who is 55 or older: Do not
let anyone mislead you; for you, the Social Security system will not change in
any way.

For younger workers, the Social Security system has serious problems that will
grow worse with time. Social Security was created decades ago for a very
different era. In those days, people did not live as long. Benefits were much
lower than they are today. And a half century ago, about 16 workers paid into
the system for each person drawing benefits.

Our society has changed in ways the founders of Social Security could not have
foreseen. In today's world, people are living longer and, therefore, drawing
benefits longer. And those benefits are scheduled to rise dramatically over the
next few decades. And instead of 16 workers paying in for every beneficiary,
right now it's only about 3 workers. And over the next few decades, that number
will fall to just 2 workers per beneficiary. With each passing year, fewer
workers are paying ever- higher benefits to an ever-larger number of retirees.

So here is the result: Thirteen years from now, in 2018, Social Security will be
paying out more than it takes in. And every year afterward will bring a new
shortfall, bigger than the year before. For example, in the year 2027, the
Government will somehow have to come up with an extra $200 billion to keep the
system afloat, and by 2033, the annual shortfall would be more than $300
billion. By the year 2042, the entire system would be exhausted and bankrupt. If
steps are not taken to avert that outcome, the only solutions would be
dramatically higher taxes, massive new borrowing, or sudden and severe cuts in
Social Security benefits or other Government programs.

I recognize that 2018 and 2042 may seem a long way off. But those dates are not
so distant, as any parent will tell you. If you have a 5- year-old, you're
already concerned about how you'll pay for college tuition 13 years down the
road. If you've got children in their twenties, as some of us do, the idea of
Social Security collapsing before they retire does not seem like a small matter.
And it should not be a small matter to the United States Congress. You and I
share a responsibility. We must pass reforms that solve the financial problems
of Social Security once and for all.

Fixing Social Security permanently will require an open, candid review of the
options. Some have suggested limiting benefits for wealthy retirees. Former
Congressman Tim Penny has raised the possibility of indexing benefits to prices
rather than wages. During the 1990s, my predecessor, President Clinton, spoke of
increasing the retirement age. Former Senator John Breaux suggested discouraging
early collection of Social Security benefits. The late Senator Daniel Patrick
Moynihan recommended changing the way benefits are calculated. All these ideas
are on the table.

I know that none of these reforms would be easy. But we have to move ahead with
courage and honesty, because our children's retirement security is more
important than partisan politics. I will work with Members of Congress to find
the most effective combination of reforms. I will listen to anyone who has a
good idea to offer. We must, however, be guided by some basic principles. We
must make Social Security permanently sound, not leave that task for another
day. We must not jeopardize our economic strength by increasing payroll taxes.
We must ensure that lower income Americans get the help they need to have
dignity and peace of mind in their retirement. We must guarantee there is no
change for those now retired or nearing retirement. And we must take care that
any changes in the system are gradual, so younger workers have years to prepare
and plan for their future.

As we fix Social Security, we also have the responsibility to make the system a
better deal for younger workers. And the best way to reach that goal is through
voluntary personal retirement accounts. Here is how the idea works. Right now, a
set portion of the money you earn is taken out of your paycheck to pay for the
Social Security benefits of today's retirees. If you're a younger worker, I
believe you should be able to set aside part of that money in your own
retirement account, so you can build a nest egg for your own future.

Here's why the personal accounts are a better deal. Your money will grow over
time at a greater rate than anything the current system can deliver, and your
account will provide money for retirement over and above the check you will
receive from Social Security. In addition, you'll be able to pass along the
money that accumulates in your personal account, if you wish, to your children
and--or grandchildren. And best of all, the money in the account is yours, and
the Government can never take it away.

The goal here is greater security in retirement, so we will set careful
guidelines for personal accounts. We'll make sure the money can only go into a
conservative mix of bonds and stock funds. We'll make sure that your earnings
are not eaten up by hidden Wall Street fees. We'll make sure there are good
options to protect your investments from sudden market swings on the eve of your
retirement. We'll make sure a personal account cannot be emptied out all at once
but rather paid out over time as an addition to traditional Social Security
benefits. And we'll make sure this plan is fiscally responsible by starting
personal retirement accounts gradually and raising the yearly limits on
contributions over time, eventually permitting all workers to set aside 4
percentage points of their payroll taxes in their accounts.

Personal retirement accounts should be familiar to Federal employees, because
you already have something similar called the Thrift Savings Plan, which lets
workers deposit a portion of their paychecks into any of five different broadly
based investment funds. It's time to extend the same security and choice and
ownership to young Americans.

Our second great responsibility to our children and grandchildren is to honor
and to pass along the values that sustain a free society. So many of my
generation, after a long journey, have come home to family and faith and are
determined to bring up responsible, moral children. Government is not the source
of these values, but Government should never undermine them.

Because marriage is a sacred institution and the foundation of society, it
should not be redefined by activist judges. For the good of families, children,
and society, I support a constitutional amendment to protect the institution of
marriage.

Because a society is measured by how it treats the weak and vulnerable, we must
strive to build a culture of life. Medical research can help us reach that goal
by developing treatments and cures that save lives and help people overcome
disabilities, and I thank the Congress for doubling the funding of the National
Institutes of Health.

To build a culture of life, we must also ensure that scientific advances always
serve human dignity, not take advantage of some lives for the benefit of others.
We should all be able to agree on some clear standards. I will work with
Congress to ensure that human embryos are not created for experimentation or
grown for body parts and that human life is never bought or sold as a commodity.
America will continue to lead the world in medical research that is ambitious,
aggressive, and always ethical.

Because courts must always deliver impartial justice, judges have a duty to
faithfully interpret the law, not legislate from the bench. As President, I have
a constitutional responsibility to nominate men and women who understand the
role of courts in our democracy and are well- qualified to serve on the bench,
and I have done so. The Constitution also gives the Senate a responsibility:
Every judicial nominee deserves an up-or-down vote.

Because one of the deepest values of our country is compassion, we must never
turn away from any citizen who feels isolated from the opportunities of America.
Our Government will continue to support faith-based and community groups that
bring hope to harsh places. Now we need to focus on giving young people,
especially young men in our cities, better options than apathy or gangs or jail.
Tonight I propose a 3-year initiative to help organizations keep young people
out of gangs and show young men an ideal of manhood that respects women and
rejects violence. Taking on gang life will be one part of a broader outreach to
at-risk youth, which involves parents and pastors, coaches and community leaders
in programs ranging from literacy to sports. And I am proud that the leader of
this nationwide effort will be our First Lady, Laura Bush.

Because HIV/AIDS brings suffering and fear into so many lives, I ask you to
reauthorize the Ryan White Act to encourage prevention and provide care and
treatment to the victims of that disease. And as we update this important law,
we must focus our efforts on fellow citizens with the highest rates of new
cases, African American men and women.

Because one of the main sources of our national unity is our belief in equal
justice, we need to make sure Americans of all races and backgrounds have
confidence in the system that provides justice. In America, we must make doubly
sure no person is held to account for a crime he or she did not commit, so we
are dramatically expanding the use of DNA evidence to prevent wrongful
conviction. Soon I will send to Congress a proposal to fund special training for
defense counsel in capital cases, because people on trial for their lives must
have competent lawyers by their side.

Our third responsibility to future generations is to leave them an America that
is safe from danger and protected by peace. We will pass along to our children
all the freedoms we enjoy, and chief among them is freedom from fear.

In the 3\1/2\ years since September the 11th, 2001, we have taken unprecedented
actions to protect Americans. We've created a new Department of Government to
defend our homeland, focused the FBI on preventing terrorism, begun to reform
our intelligence agencies, broken up terror cells across the country, expanded
research on defenses against biological and chemical attack, improved border
security, and trained more than a half million first-responders. Police and
firefighters, air marshals, researchers, and so many others are working every
day to make our homeland safer, and we thank them all.

Our Nation, working with allies and friends, has also confronted the enemy
abroad with measures that are determined, successful, and continuing. The Al
Qaida terror network that attacked our country still has leaders, but many of
its top commanders have been removed. There are still governments that sponsor
and harbor terrorists, but their number has declined. There are still regimes
seeking weapons of mass destruction but no longer without attention and without
consequence. Our country is still the target of terrorists who want to kill many
and intimidate us all, and we will stay on the offensive against them until the
fight is won.

Pursuing our enemies is a vital commitment of the war on terror, and I thank the
Congress for providing our service men and women with the resources they have
needed. During this time of war, we must continue to support our military and
give them the tools for victory.

Other nations around the globe have stood with us. In Afghanistan, an
international force is helping provide security. In Iraq, 28 countries have
troops on the ground, the United Nations and the European Union provided
technical assistance for the elections, and NATO is leading a mission to help
train Iraqi officers. We're cooperating with 60 governments in the Proliferation
Security Initiative to detect and stop the transit of dangerous materials. We're
working closely with the governments in Asia to convince North Korea to abandon
its nuclear ambitions. Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and nine other countries have
captured or detained Al Qaida terrorists. In the next 4 years, my administration
will continue to build the coalitions that will defeat the dangers of our time.

In the long term, the peace we seek will only be achieved by eliminating the
conditions that feed radicalism and ideologies of murder. If whole regions of
the world remain in despair and grow in hatred, they will be the recruiting
grounds for terror, and that terror will stalk America and other free nations
for decades. The only force powerful enough to stop the rise of tyranny and
terror and replace hatred with hope is the force of human freedom. Our enemies
know this, and that is why the terrorist Zarqawi recently declared war on what
he called the "evil principle" of democracy. And we've declared our own
intention: America will stand with the allies of freedom to support democratic
movements in the Middle East and beyond, with the ultimate goal of ending
tyranny in our world.

The United States has no right, no desire, and no intention to impose our form
of government on anyone else. That is one of the main differences between us and
our enemies. They seek to impose and expand an empire of oppression in which a
tiny group of brutal, self-appointed rulers control every aspect of every life.
Our aim is to build and preserve a community of free and independent nations,
with governments that answer to their citizens and reflect their own cultures.
And because democracies respect their own people and their neighbors, the
advance of freedom will lead to peace.

That advance has great momentum in our time, shown by women voting in
Afghanistan and Palestinians choosing a new direction and the people of Ukraine
asserting their democratic rights and electing a President. We are witnessing
landmark events in the history of liberty, and in the coming years, we will add
to that story.

The beginnings of reform and democracy in the Palestinian territories are now
showing the power of freedom to break old patterns of violence and failure.
Tomorrow morning Secretary of State Rice departs on a trip that will take her to
Israel and the West Bank for meetings with Prime Minister Sharon and President
Abbas. She will discuss with them how we and our friends can help the
Palestinian people end terror and build the institutions of a peaceful,
independent, democratic state. To promote this democracy, I will ask Congress
for $350 million to support Palestinian political, economic, and security
reforms. The goal of two democratic states, Israel and Palestine, living side by
side in peace is within reach, and America will help them achieve that goal.

To promote peace and stability in the broader Middle East, the United States
will work with our friends in the region to fight the common threat of terror,
while we encourage a higher standard of freedom. Hopeful reform is already
taking hold in an arc from Morocco to Jordan to Bahrain. The Government of Saudi
Arabia can demonstrate its leadership in the region by expanding the role of its
people in determining their future. And the great and proud nation of Egypt,
which showed the way toward peace in the Middle East, can now show the way
toward democracy in the Middle East.

To promote peace in the broader Middle East, we must confront regimes that
continue to harbor terrorists and pursue weapons of mass murder. Syria still
allows its territory and parts of Lebanon to be used by terrorists who seek to
destroy every chance of peace in the region. You have passed and we are applying
the Syrian Accountability Act, and we expect the Syrian Government to end all
support for terror and open the door to freedom. Today, Iran remains the world's
primary state sponsor of terror, pursuing nuclear weapons while depriving its
people of the freedom they seek and deserve. We are working with European allies
to make clear to the Iranian regime that it must give up its uranium enrichment
program and any plutonium reprocessing and end its support for terror. And to
the Iranian people, I say tonight: As you stand for your own liberty, America
stands with you.

Our generational commitment to the advance of freedom, especially in the Middle
East, is now being tested and honored in Iraq. That country is a vital front in
the war on terror, which is why the terrorists have chosen to make a stand
there. Our men and women in uniform are fighting terrorists in Iraq so we do not
have to face them here at home. And the victory of freedom in Iraq will
strengthen a new ally in the war on terror, inspire democratic reformers from
Damascus to Tehran, bring more hope and progress to a troubled region, and
thereby lift a terrible threat from the lives of our children and grandchildren.

We will succeed because the Iraqi people value their own liberty, as they showed
the world last Sunday. Across Iraq, often at great risk, millions of citizens
went to the polls and elected 275 men and women to represent them in a new
Transitional National Assembly. A young woman in Baghdad told of waking to the
sound of mortar fire on election day and wondering if it might be too dangerous
to vote. She said, "Hearing those explosions, it occurred to me: The insurgents
are weak; they are afraid of democracy; they are losing. So I got my husband and
I got my parents, and we all came out and voted together." Americans recognize
that spirit of liberty, because we share it. In any nation, casting your vote is
an act of civic responsibility. For millions of Iraqis, it was also an act of
personal courage, and they have earned the respect of us all.

One of Iraq's leading democracy and human rights advocates is Safia Taleb
al-Suhail. She says of her country, "We were occupied for 35 years by Saddam
Hussein. That was the real occupation. Thank you to the American people who paid
the cost but, most of all, to the soldiers." Eleven years ago, Safia's father
was assassinated by Saddam's intelligence service. Three days ago in Baghdad,
Safia was finally able to vote for the leaders of her country, and we are
honored that she is with us tonight.

The terrorists and insurgents are violently opposed to democracy and will
continue to attack it. Yet, the terrorists' most powerful myth is being
destroyed. The whole world is seeing that the car bombers and assassins are not
only fighting coalition forces; they are trying to destroy the hopes of Iraqis,
expressed in free elections. And the whole world now knows that a small group of
extremists will not overturn the will of the Iraqi people.

We will succeed in Iraq because Iraqis are determined to fight for their own
freedom and to write their own history. As Prime Minister Allawi said in his
speech to Congress last September, "Ordinary Iraqis are anxious to shoulder all
the security burdens of our country as quickly as possible." That is the
natural desire of an independent nation, and it is also the stated mission of
our coalition in Iraq. The new political situation in Iraq opens a new phase of
our work in that country.

At the recommendation of our commanders on the ground and in consultation with
the Iraqi Government, we will increasingly focus our efforts on helping prepare
more capable Iraqi security forces, forces with skilled officers and an
effective command structure. As those forces become more self-reliant and take
on greater security responsibilities, America and its coalition partners will
increasingly be in a supporting role. In the end, Iraqis must be able to defend
their own country, and we will help that proud new nation secure its liberty.

Recently an Iraqi interpreter said to a reporter, "Tell America not to abandon
us." He and all Iraqis can be certain: While our military strategy is adapting
to circumstances, our commitment remains firm and unchanging. We are standing
for the freedom of our Iraqi friends, and freedom in Iraq will make America
safer for generations to come. We will not set an artificial timetable for
leaving Iraq, because that would embolden the terrorists and make them believe
they can wait us out. We are in Iraq to achieve a result, a country that is
democratic, representative of all its people, at peace with its neighbors, and
able to defend itself. And when that result is achieved, our men and women
serving in Iraq will return home with the honor they have earned.

Right now, Americans in uniform are serving at posts across the world, often
taking great risks on my orders. We have given them training and equipment, and
they have given us an example of idealism and character that makes every
American proud. The volunteers of our military are unrelenting in battle,
unwavering in loyalty, unmatched in honor and decency, and every day they're
making our Nation more secure. Some of our service men and women have survived
terrible injuries, and this grateful country will do everything we can to help
them recover. And we have said farewell to some very good men and women who died
for our freedom and whose memory this Nation will honor forever.

One name we honor is Marine Corps Sergeant Byron Norwood of Pflugerville, Texas,
who was killed during the assault on Fallujah. His mom, Janet, sent me a letter
and told me how much Byron loved being a marine and how proud he was to be on
the frontline against terror. She wrote, "When Byron was home the last time, I
said that I wanted to protect him like I had since he was born. He just hugged
me and said, 'You've done your job, Mom. Now it is my turn to protect you.' "
Ladies and gentlemen, with grateful hearts we honor freedom's defenders and our
military families, represented here this evening by Sergeant Norwood's mom and
dad, Janet and Bill Norwood.

[At this point, in the First Lady's box, guest Safia Taleb al-Suhail embraced
guest Janet Norwood.]

In these 4 years, Americans have seen the unfolding of large events. We have
known times of sorrow and hours of uncertainty and days of victory. In all this
history, even when we have disagreed, we have seen threads of purpose that unite
us. The attack on freedom in our world has reaffirmed our confidence in
freedom's power to change the world. We are all part of a great venture: To
extend the promise of freedom in our country, to renew the values that sustain
our liberty, and to spread the peace that freedom brings.

As Franklin Roosevelt once reminded Americans, "Each age is a dream that is
dying, or one that is coming to birth." And we live in the country where the
biggest dreams are born. The abolition of slavery was only a dream until it was
fulfilled. The liberation of Europe from fascism was only a dream until it was
achieved. The fall of imperial communism was only a dream until, one day, it was
accomplished. Our generation has dreams of its own, and we also go forward with
confidence. The road of providence is uneven and unpredictable, yet we know
where it leads: It leads to freedom.

Thank you, and may God bless America.

2006:
Mr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, Members of Congress, members of the Supreme
Court and Diplomatic Corps, distinguished guests and fellow citizens:

Today our Nation lost a beloved, graceful, courageous woman who called America
to its founding ideals and carried on a noble dream. Tonight we are comforted by
the hope of a glad reunion with the husband who was taken from her so long ago,
and we are grateful for the good life of Coretta Scott King.

Every time I am invited to this rostrum, I am humbled by the privilege, and
mindful of the history we have seen together. We have gathered under this
Capitol dome in moments of national mourning and national achievement. We have
served America through one of the most consequential periods of our history, and
it has been my honor to serve with you.

In a system of two parties, two chambers, and two elected branches, there will
always be differences and debate. But even tough debates can be conducted in a
civil tone, and our differences cannot be allowed to harden into anger. To
confront the great issues before us, we must act in a spirit of good will and
respect for one another, and I will do my part. Tonight the state of our Union
is strong, and together we will make it stronger.

In this decisive year, you and I will make choices that determine both the
future and the character of our country. We will choose to act confidently in
pursuing the enemies of freedom, or retreat from our duties in the hope of an
easier life. We will choose to build our prosperity by leading the world
economy, or shut ourselves off from trade and opportunity. In a complex and
challenging time, the road of isolationism and protectionism may seem broad and
inviting, yet it ends in danger and decline. The only way to protect our people,
the only way to secure the peace, the only way to control our destiny is by our
leadership, so the United States of America will continue to lead.

Abroad, our Nation is committed to a historic, long-term goal. We seek the end
of tyranny in our world. Some dismiss that goal as misguided idealism. In
reality, the future security of America depends on it. On September 11, 2001, we
found that problems originating in a failed and oppressive state 7,000 miles
away could bring murder and destruction to our country. Dictatorships shelter
terrorists, feed resentment and radicalism, and seek weapons of mass
destruction. Democracies replace resentment with hope, respect the rights of
their citizens and their neighbors, and join the fight against terror. Every
step toward freedom in the world makes our country safer, and so we will act
boldly in freedom's cause.

Far from being a hopeless dream, the advance of freedom is the great story of
our time. In 1945, there were about two dozen lonely democracies in the world.
Today, there are 122. And we are writing a new chapter in the story of
self-government, with women lining up to vote in Afghanistan, and millions of
Iraqis marking their liberty with purple ink, and men and women from Lebanon to
Egypt debating the rights of individuals and the necessity of freedom. At the
start of 2006, more than half the people of our world live in democratic
nations. And we do not forget the other half, in places like Syria, Burma,
Zimbabwe, North Korea, and Iran, because the demands of justice, and the peace
of this world, require their freedom as well.

No one can deny the success of freedom, but some men rage and fight against it.
And one of the main sources of reaction and opposition is radical Islam, the
perversion by a few of a noble faith into an ideology of terror and death.
Terrorists like bin Laden are serious about mass murder, and all of us must take
their declared intentions seriously. They seek to impose a heartless system of
totalitarian control throughout the Middle East and arm themselves with weapons
of mass murder. Their aim is to seize power in Iraq and use it as a safe haven
to launch attacks against America and the world. Lacking the military strength
to challenge us directly, the terrorists have chosen the weapon of fear. When
they murder children at a school in Beslan, or blow up commuters in London, or
behead a bound captive, the terrorists hope these horrors will break our will,
allowing the violent to inherit the Earth. But they have miscalculated: we love
our freedom, and we will fight to keep it.

In a time of testing, we cannot find security by abandoning our commitments and
retreating within our borders. If we were to leave these vicious attackers
alone, they would not leave us alone. They would simply move the battlefield to
our own shores. There is no peace in retreat. And there is no honor in retreat.
By allowing radical Islam to work its will, by leaving an assaulted world to
fend for itself, we would signal to all that we no longer believe in our own
ideals, or even in our own courage. But our enemies and our friends can be
certain: the United States will not retreat from the world, and we will never
surrender to evil.

America rejects the false comfort of isolationism. We are the Nation that saved
liberty in Europe, and liberated death camps, and helped raise up democracies,
and faced down an evil empire. Once again, we accept the call of history to
deliver the oppressed, and move this world toward peace.

We remain on the offensive against terror networks. We have killed or captured
many of their leaders. And for the others, their day will come. We remain on the
offensive in Afghanistan, where a fine president and national assembly are
fighting terror while building the institutions of a new democracy.

And we are on the offensive in Iraq, with a clear plan for victory. First, we
are helping Iraqis build an inclusive government, so that old resentments will
be eased and the insurgency will be marginalized. Second, we are continuing
reconstruction efforts and helping the Iraqi government to fight corruption and
build a modern economy, so all Iraqis can experience the benefits of freedom.
Third, we are striking terrorist targets while we train Iraqi forces that are
increasingly capable of defeating the enemy. Iraqis are showing their courage
every day, and we are proud to be their allies in the cause of freedom.

Our work in Iraq is difficult because our enemy is brutal. But that brutality
has not stopped the dramatic progress of a new democracy. In less than 3 years,
that nation has gone from dictatorship, to liberation, to sovereignty, to a
constitution, to national elections. At the same time, our coalition has been
relentless in shutting off terrorist infiltration, clearing out insurgent
strongholds, and turning over territory to Iraqi security forces. I am confident
in our plan for victory. I am confident in the will of the Iraqi people. I am
confident in the skill and spirit of our military. Fellow citizens, we are in
this fight to win, and we are winning.

The road of victory is the road that will take our troops home. As we make
progress on the ground, and Iraqi forces increasingly take the lead, we should
be able to further decrease our troop levels; but those decisions will be made
by our military commanders, not by politicians in Washington, D.C.

Our coalition has learned from our experience in Iraq. We have adjusted our
military tactics and changed our approach to reconstruction. Along the way, we
have benefited from responsible criticism and counsel offered by Members of
Congress of both parties. In the coming year, I will continue to reach out and
seek your good advice.

Yet there is a difference between responsible criticism that aims for success
and defeatism that refuses to acknowledge anything but failure. Hindsight alone
is not wisdom. And second-guessing is not a strategy.

With so much in the balance, those of us in public office have a duty to speak
with candor. A sudden withdrawal of our forces from Iraq would abandon our Iraqi
allies to death and prison, put men like bin Laden and Zarqawi in charge of a
strategic country, and show that a pledge from America means little. Members of
Congress: however we feel about the decisions and debates of the past, our
Nation has only one option: we must keep our word, defeat our enemies, and stand
behind the American military in its vital mission.

Our men and women in uniform are making sacrifices and showing a sense of duty
stronger than all fear. They know what it is like to fight house to house in a
maze of streets, to wear heavy gear in the desert heat, to see a comrade killed
by a roadside bomb. And those who know the costs also know the stakes. Marine
Staff Sergeant Dan Clay was killed last month fighting in Fallujah. He left
behind a letter to his family, but his words could just as well be addressed to
every American. Here is what Dan wrote: "I know what honor is. It has been an
honor to protect and serve all of you. I faced death with the secure knowledge
that you would not have to. Never falter. Don't hesitate to honor and support
those of us who have the honor of protecting that which is worth protecting."

Staff Sergeant Dan Clay's wife, Lisa, and his mom and dad, Sara Jo and Bud, are
with us this evening. Welcome. Our Nation is grateful to the fallen, who live in
the memory of our country. We are grateful to all who volunteer to wear our
Nation's uniform; and as we honor our brave troops, let us never forget the
sacrifices of America's military families.

Our offensive against terror involves more than military action. Ultimately, the
only way to defeat the terrorists is to defeat their dark vision of hatred and
fear by offering the hopeful alternative of political freedom and peaceful
change. So the United States of America supports democratic reform across the
broader Middle East. Elections are vital, but they are only the beginning.
Raising up a democracy requires the rule of law, protection of minorities, and
strong, accountable institutions that last longer than a single vote. The great
people of Egypt have voted in a multiparty presidential election, and now their
government should open paths of peaceful opposition that will reduce the appeal
of radicalism. The Palestinian people have voted in elections, and now the
leaders of Hamas must recognize Israel, disarm, reject terrorism, and work for
lasting peace. Saudi Arabia has taken the first steps of reform. Now it can
offer its people a better future by pressing forward with those efforts.

Democracies in the Middle East will not look like our own, because they will
reflect the traditions of their own citizens. Yet liberty is the future of every
nation in the Middle East, because liberty is the right and hope of all
humanity.

The same is true of Iran, a nation now held hostage by a small clerical elite
that is isolating and repressing its people. The regime in that country sponsors
terrorists in the Palestinian territories and in Lebanon, and that must come to
an end. The Iranian government is defying the world with its nuclear ambitions,
and the nations of the world must not permit the Iranian regime to gain nuclear
weapons. America will continue to rally the world to confront these threats. And
tonight, let me speak directly to the citizens of Iran: America respects you,
and we respect your country. We respect your right to choose your own future and
win your own freedom. And our Nation hopes one day to be the closest of friends
with a free and democratic Iran.

To overcome dangers in our world, we must also take the offensive by encouraging
economic progress, fighting disease, and spreading hope in hopeless lands.
Isolationism would not only tie our hands in fighting enemies; it would keep us
from helping our friends in desperate need. We show compassion abroad because
Americans believe in the God-given dignity and worth of a villager with
HIV/AIDS, or an infant with malaria, or a refugee fleeing genocide, or a young
girl sold into slavery. We also show compassion abroad because regions
overwhelmed by poverty, corruption, and despair are sources of terrorism,
organized crime, human trafficking, and the drug trade.

In recent years, you and I have taken unprecedented action to fight AIDS and
malaria, expand the education of girls, and reward developing nations that are
moving forward with economic and political reform. For people everywhere, the
United States is a partner for a better life. Shortchanging these efforts would
increase the suffering and chaos of our world, undercut our long-term security,
and dull the conscience of our country. I urge Members of Congress to serve the
interests of America by showing the compassion of America.

Our country must also remain on the offensive against terrorism here at home.
The enemy has not lost the desire or capability to attack us. Fortunately, this
Nation has superb professionals in law enforcement, intelligence, the military,
and homeland security. These men and women are dedicating their lives to
protecting us all, and they deserve our support and our thanks. They also
deserve the same tools they already use to fight drug trafficking and organized
crime, so I ask you to reauthorize the PATRIOT Act.

It is said that prior to the attacks of September 11, our government failed to
connect the dots of the conspiracy. We now know that two of the hijackers in the
United States placed telephone calls to al Qaeda operatives overseas. But we did
not know about their plans until it was too late. So to prevent another attack,
based on authority given to me by the Constitution and by statute, I have
authorized a terrorist surveillance program to aggressively pursue the
international communications of suspected al Qaeda operatives and affiliates to
and from America. Previous Presidents have used the same constitutional
authority I have, and Federal courts have approved the use of that authority.
Appropriate Members of Congress have been kept informed. This terrorist
surveillance program has helped prevent terrorist attacks. It remains essential
to the security of America. If there are people inside our country who are
talking with al Qaeda, we want to know about it, because we will not sit back
and wait to be hit again.

In all these areas, from the disruption of terror networks, to victory in Iraq,
to the spread of freedom and hope in troubled regions, we need the support of
our friends and allies. To draw that support, we must always be clear in our
principles and willing to act. The only alternative to American leadership is a
dramatically more dangerous and anxious world. Yet we also choose to lead
because it is a privilege to serve the values that gave us birth. American
leaders, from Roosevelt to Truman to Kennedy to Reagan, rejected isolation and
retreat because they knew that America is always more secure when freedom is on
the march. Our own generation is in a long war against a determined enemy, a war
that will be fought by Presidents of both parties, who will need steady
bipartisan support from the Congress. And tonight I ask for yours. Together, let
us protect our country, support the men and women who defend us, and lead this
world toward freedom.

Here at home, America also has a great opportunity: we will build the prosperity
of our country by strengthening our economic leadership in the world.

Our economy is healthy and vigorous and growing faster than other major
industrialized nations. In the last 2\1/2\ years, America has created 4.6
million new jobs, more than Japan and the European Union combined. Even in the
face of higher energy prices and natural disasters, the American people have
turned in an economic performance that is the envy of the world.

The American economy is preeminent, but we cannot afford to be complacent. In a
dynamic world economy, we are seeing new competitors like China and India. This
creates uncertainty, which makes it easier to feed people's fears. And so we are
seeing some old temptations return. Protectionists want to escape competition,
pretending that we can keep our high standard of living while walling off our
economy. Others say that the government needs to take a larger role in directing
the economy, centralizing more power in Washington and increasing taxes. We hear
claims that immigrants are somehow bad for the economy, even though this economy
could not function without them. All these are forms of economic retreat, and
they lead in the same direction, toward a stagnant and second-rate economy.

Tonight I will set out a better path, an agenda for a Nation that competes with
confidence, an agenda that will raise standards of living and generate new jobs.
Americans should not fear our economic future, because we intend to shape it.

Keeping America competitive begins with keeping our economy growing, and our
economy grows when Americans have more of their own money to spend, save, and
invest. In the last 5 years, the tax relief you passed has left $880 billion in
the hands of American workers, investors, small businesses, and families; and
they have used it to help produce more than 4 years of uninterrupted economic
growth. Yet the tax relief is set to expire in the next few years. If we do
nothing, American families will face a massive tax increase they do not expect
and will not welcome.

Because America needs more than a temporary expansion, we need more than
temporary tax relief. I urge the Congress to act responsibly and make the tax
cuts permanent.

Keeping America competitive requires us to be good stewards of tax dollars.
Every year of my Presidency, we have reduced the growth of nonsecurity
discretionary spending, and last year you passed bills that cut this spending.
This year my budget will cut it again and reduce or eliminate more than 140
programs that are performing poorly or not fulfilling essential priorities. By
passing these reforms, we will save the American taxpayer another $14 billion
next year and stay on track to cut the deficit in half by 2009. I am pleased
that Members of Congress are working on earmark reform, because the Federal
budget has too many special interest projects. And we can tackle this problem
together, if you pass the line-item veto.

We must also confront the larger challenge of mandatory spending, or
entitlements. This year, the first of about 78 million baby boomers turn 60,
including two of my dad's favorite people, me and President Clinton. This
milestone is more than a personal crisis; it is a national challenge. The
retirement of the baby boom generation will put unprecedented strains on the
Federal Government. By 2030, spending for Social Security, Medicare, and
Medicaid alone will be almost 60 percent of the entire Federal budget. And that
will present future Congresses with impossible choices, staggering tax
increases, immense deficits, or deep cuts in every category of spending.

Congress did not act last year on my proposal to save Social Security; yet the
rising cost of entitlements is a problem that is not going away. And with every
year we fail to act, the situation gets worse. So tonight, I ask you to join me
in creating a commission to examine the full impact of baby boom retirements on
Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. This commission should include Members
of Congress of both parties, and offer bipartisan solutions. We need to put
aside partisan politics, work together, and get this problem solved.

Keeping America competitive requires us to open more markets for all that
Americans make and grow. One out of every five factory jobs in America is
related to global trade, and we want people everywhere to buy American. With
open markets and a level playing field, no one can outproduce or outcompete the
American worker.

Keeping America competitive requires an immigration system that upholds our
laws, reflects our values, and serves the interests of our economy. Our Nation
needs orderly and secure borders. To meet this goal, we must have stronger
immigration enforcement and border protection. And we must have a rational,
humane guest worker program that rejects amnesty, allows temporary jobs for
people who seek them legally, and reduces smuggling and crime at the border.

Keeping America competitive requires affordable health care. Our government has
a responsibility to help provide health care for the poor and the elderly, and
we are meeting that responsibility. For all Americans, we must confront the
rising cost of care, strengthen the doctor-patient relationship, and help people
afford the insurance coverage they need. We will make wider use of electronic
records and other health information technology to help control costs and reduce
dangerous medical errors. We will strengthen health savings accounts by making
sure individuals and small business employees can buy insurance with the same
advantages that people working for big businesses now get. We will do more to
make this coverage portable, so workers can switch jobs without having to worry
about losing their health insurance. And because lawsuits are driving many good
doctors out of practice, leaving women in nearly 1,500 American counties without
a single OB-GYN, I ask the Congress to pass medical liability reform this year.

Keeping America competitive requires affordable energy. Here we have a serious
problem: America is addicted to oil, which is often imported from unstable parts
of the world.

The best way to break this addiction is through technology. Since 2001, we have
spent nearly $10 billion to develop cleaner, cheaper, and more reliable
alternative energy sources; and we are on the threshold of incredible advances.
So tonight, I announce the Advanced Energy Initiative, a 22 percent increase in
clean energy research at the Department of Energy, to push for breakthroughs in
two vital areas. To change how we power our homes and offices, we will invest
more in zero- emission coal-fired plants; revolutionary solar and wind
technologies; and clean, safe nuclear energy.

We must also change how we power our automobiles. We will increase our research
in better batteries for hybrid and electric cars and in pollution-free cars that
run on hydrogen. We will also fund additional research in cutting-edge methods
of producing ethanol, not just from corn but from wood chips, stalks, or switch
grass. Our goal is to make this new kind of ethanol practical and competitive
within 6 years. Breakthroughs on this and other new technologies will help us
reach another great goal: to replace more than 75 percent of our oil imports
from the Middle East by 2025. By applying the talent and technology of America,
this country can dramatically improve our environment, move beyond a
petroleum-based economy, and make our dependence on Middle Eastern oil a thing
of the past.

And to keep America competitive, one commitment is necessary above all: we must
continue to lead the world in human talent and creativity. Our greatest
advantage in the world has always been our educated, hardworking, ambitious
people; and we are going to keep that edge. Tonight I announce the American
Competitiveness Initiative, to encourage innovation throughout our economy and
to give our Nation's children a firm grounding in math and science.

First: I propose to double the Federal commitment to the most critical basic
research programs in the physical sciences over the next 10 years. This funding
will support the work of America's most creative minds as they explore promising
areas such as nanotechnology, supercomputing, and alternative energy sources.

Second: I propose to make permanent the research and development tax credit, to
encourage bolder private-sector investment in technology. With more research in
both the public and private sectors, we will improve our quality of life and
ensure that America will lead the world in opportunity and innovation for
decades to come.

Third: We need to encourage children to take more math and science and make sure
those courses are rigorous enough to compete with other nations. We have made a
good start in the early grades with the No Child Left Behind Act, which is
raising standards and lifting test scores across our country. Tonight, I propose
to train 70,000 high school teachers to lead advanced placement courses in math
and science; bring 30,000 math and science professionals to teach in classrooms;
and give early help to students who struggle with math, so they have a better
chance at good high-wage jobs. If we ensure that America's children succeed in
life, they will ensure that America succeeds in the world.

Preparing our Nation to compete in the world is a goal that all of us can share.
I urge you to support the American Competitiveness Initiative, and together we
will show the world what the American people can achieve.

America is a great force for freedom and prosperity. Yet our greatness is not
measured in power or luxuries, but by who we are and how we treat one another.
So we strive to be a compassionate, decent, hopeful society.

In recent years, America has become a more hopeful Nation. Violent crime rates
have fallen to their lowest levels since the 1970s. Welfare cases have dropped
by more than half over the past decade. Drug use among youth is down 19 percent
since 2001. There are fewer abortions in America than at any point in the last
three decades, and the number of children born to teenage mothers has been
falling for a dozen years in a row.

These gains are evidence of a quiet transformation, a revolution of conscience,
in which a rising generation is finding that a life of personal responsibility
is a life of fulfillment. Government has played a role. Wise policies such as
welfare reform, drug education, and support for abstinence and adoption have
made a difference in the character of our country. And everyone here tonight,
Democrat and Republican, has a right to be proud of this record.

Yet many Americans, especially parents, still have deep concerns about the
direction of our culture and the health of our most basic institutions. They are
concerned about unethical conduct by public officials, and discouraged by
activist courts that try to redefine marriage. And they worry about children in
our society who need direction and love, and about fellow citizens still
displaced by natural disaster, and about suffering caused by treatable diseases.

As we look at these challenges, we must never give in to the belief that America
is in decline or that our culture is doomed to unravel. The American people know
better than that. We have proven the pessimists wrong before, and we will do it
again.

A hopeful society depends on courts that deliver equal justice under the law.
The Supreme Court now has two superb new members on its bench, Chief Justice
John Roberts and Justice Sam Alito. I thank the Senate for confirming both of
them. I will continue to nominate men and women who understand that judges must
be servants of the law, and not legislate from the bench. Today marks the
official retirement of a very special American. For 24 years of faithful service
to our Nation, the United States is grateful to Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.

A hopeful society has institutions of science and medicine that do not cut
ethical corners and that recognize the matchless value of every life. Tonight, I
ask you to pass legislation to prohibit the most egregious abuses of medical
research: human cloning in all its forms, creating or implanting embryos for
experiments, creating human-animal hybrids, and buying, selling or patenting
human embryos. Human life is a gift from our Creator, and that gift should never
be discarded, devalued, or put up for sale.

A hopeful society expects elected officials to uphold the public trust.
Honorable people in both parties are working on reforms to strengthen the
ethical standards of Washington, and I support your efforts. Each of us has made
a pledge to be worthy of public responsibility, and that is a pledge we must
never forget, never dismiss, and never betray.

As we renew the promise of our institutions, let us also show the character of
America in our compassion and care for one another.

A hopeful society gives special attention to children who lack direction and
love. Through the Helping America's Youth Initiative, we are encouraging caring
adults to get involved in the life of a child, and this good work is being led
by our First Lady, Laura Bush. This year we will add resources to encourage
young people to stay in school, so more of America's youth can raise their
sights and achieve their dreams.

A hopeful society comes to the aid of fellow citizens in times of suffering and
emergency and stays at it until they are back on their feet. So far the Federal
Government has committed $85 billion to the people of the gulf coast and New
Orleans. We are removing debris, repairing highways, and building stronger
levees. We are providing business loans and housing assistance. Yet as we meet
these immediate needs, we must also address deeper challenges that existed
before the storm arrived. In New Orleans and in other places, many of our fellow
citizens have felt excluded from the promise of our country. The answer is not
only temporary relief, but schools that teach every child and job skills that
bring upward mobility and more opportunities to own a home and start a business.
As we recover from a disaster, let us also work for the day when all Americans
are protected by justice, equal in hope, and rich in opportunity.

A hopeful society acts boldly to fight diseases like HIV/AIDS, which can be
prevented and treated and defeated. More than a million Americans live with HIV,
and half of all AIDS cases occur among African Americans. I ask Congress to
reform and reauthorize the Ryan White Act and provide new funding to States so
we end the waiting lists for AIDS medicines in America. We will also lead a
nationwide effort, working closely with African American churches and
faith-based groups, to deliver rapid HIV tests to millions, end the stigma of
AIDS, and come closer to the day when there are no new infections in America.

Fellow citizens, we have been called to leadership in a period of consequence.
We have entered a great ideological conflict we did nothing to invite. We see
great changes in science and commerce that will influence all our lives. And
sometimes it can seem that history is turning in a wide arc, toward an unknown
shore.

Yet the destination of history is determined by human action, and every great
movement of history comes to a point of choosing. Lincoln could have accepted
peace at the cost of disunity and continued slavery. Martin Luther King could
have stopped at Birmingham or at Selma and achieved only half a victory over
segregation. The United States could have accepted the permanent division of
Europe and been complicit in the oppression of others. Today, having come far in
our own historical journey, we must decide: Will we turn back, or finish well?

Before history is written down in books, it is written in courage. Like
Americans before us, we will show that courage, and we will finish well. We will
lead freedom's advance. We will compete and excel in the global economy. We will
renew the defining moral commitments of this land. And so we move forward,
optimistic about our country, faithful to its cause, and confident of the
victories to come.

May God bless America.

[Applause, the Members rising.]

2007:
TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:

Thank you very much. Tonight, I have a high privilege and
distinct honor of my own -- as the first President to begin the State of the Union
message with these words: Madam Speaker.

In his day, the late Congressman Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr., from Baltimore,
Maryland, saw Presidents Roosevelt and Truman at this rostrum. But nothing could
compare with the sight of his only daughter, Nancy, presiding tonight as Speaker
of the House of Representatives. Congratulations, Madam Speaker.

Two Members of the House and Senate are not with us tonight, and we pray for the
recovery and speedy return of Senator Tim Johnson and Congressman Charlie
Norwood.

Madam Speaker, Vice President Cheney, Members of Congress, distinguished guests,
and fellow citizens:

This rite of custom brings us together at a defining hour, when decisions are
hard and courage is tested. We enter the year 2007 with large endeavors under
way, and others that are ours to begin. In all of this, much is asked of us. We
must have the will to face difficult challenges and determined enemies, and the
wisdom to face them together.

Some in this Chamber are new to the House and Senate, and I congratulate the
Democratic majority. Congress has changed, but our responsibilities have not.
Each of us is guided by our own convictions, and to these we must stay faithful.
Yet we are all held to the same standards and called to serve the same good
purposes: to extend the Nation's prosperity, to spend the people's money wisely,
to solve problems, not leave them to future generations, to guard America
against all evil, and to keep faith with those we have sent forth to defend us.

We are not the first to come here with government divided and uncertainty in the
air. Like many before us, we can work through our differences and achieve big
things for the American people. Our citizens don't much care which side of the
aisle we sit on, as long as we are willing to cross that aisle when there is
work to be done. Our job is to make life better for our fellow Americans and
help them to build a future of hope and opportunity, and this is the business
before us tonight.

A future of hope and opportunity begins with a growing economy, and that is what
we have. We are now in the 41st month of uninterrupted job growth, in a recovery
that has created 7.2 million new jobs, so far. Unemployment is low, inflation is
low, and wages are rising. The economy is on the move, and our job is to keep it
that way, not with more government but with more enterprise.

Next week, I will deliver a full report on the state of our economy. Tonight, I
want to discuss three economic reforms that deserve to be priorities for this
Congress.

First, we must balance the Federal budget. We can do so without raising taxes.
What we need to do is impose spending discipline in Washington, D.C. We set a
goal of cutting the deficit in half by 2009, and met that goal 3 years ahead of
schedule. Now let us take the next step. In the coming weeks, I will submit a
budget that eliminates the Federal deficit within the next 5 years. I ask you to
make the same commitment. Together, we can restrain the spending appetite of the
Federal Government and balance the Federal budget.

Next, there is the matter of earmarks. These special interest items are often
slipped into bills at the last hour, when not even C-SPAN is watching. In 2005
alone, the number of earmarks grew to over 13,000 and totaled nearly $18
billion. Even worse, over 90 percent of earmarks never make it to the floor of
the House and Senate. They are dropped into committee reports that are not even
part of the bill that arrives on my desk. You did not vote them into law. I did
not sign them into law. Yet they are treated as if they have the force of law.
The time has come to end this practice. So let us work together to reform the
budget process, expose every earmark to the light of day and to a vote in
Congress, and cut the number and cost of earmarks at least in half by the end of
this session.

Finally, to keep this economy strong we must take on the challenge of
entitlements. Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid are commitments of
conscience, and so it is our duty to keep them permanently sound. Yet we are
failing in that duty, and this failure will one day leave our children with
three bad options: huge tax increases, huge deficits, or huge and immediate cuts
in benefits. Everyone in this Chamber knows this to be true, yet somehow we have
not found it in ourselves to act. So let us work together and do it now. With
enough good sense and good will, you and I can fix Medicare and Medicaid, and
save Social Security.

Spreading opportunity and hope in America also requires public schools that give
children the knowledge and character they need in life. Five years ago, we rose
above partisan differences to pass the No Child Left Behind Act, preserving
local control, raising standards, and holding those schools accountable for
results. And because we acted, students are performing better in reading and
math, and minority students are closing the achievement gap.

Now the task is to build on this success, without watering down standards,
without taking control from local communities, and without back sliding and
calling it reform. We can lift student achievement even higher by giving local
leaders flexibility to turn around failing schools, and by giving families with
children stuck in failing schools the right to choose someplace better. We must
increase funds for students who struggle, and make sure these children get the
special help they need. And we can make sure our children are prepared for the
jobs of the future, and our country is more competitive, by strengthening math
and science skills. The No Child Left Behind Act has worked for America's
children, and I ask Congress to reauthorize this good law.

A future of hope and opportunity requires that all our citizens have affordable
and available health care. When it comes to health care, government has an
obligation to care for the elderly, the disabled, and poor children, and we will
meet those responsibilities. For all other Americans, private health care
insurance is the best way to meet their needs. But many Americans cannot afford
a health insurance policy.

So tonight, I propose two new initiatives to help more Americans afford their
own insurance. First, I propose a standard tax deduction for health insurance
that will be like the standard tax deduction for dependents. Families with
health insurance will pay no income or payroll taxes on $15,000 of their income.
Single Americans with health insurance will pay no income or payroll taxes on
$7,500 of their income. With this reform, more than 100 million men, women, and
children who are now covered by employer-provided insurance will benefit from
lower tax bills.

At the same time, this reform will level the playing field for those who do not
get health insurance through their job. For Americans who now purchase health
insurance on their own, this proposal would mean a substantial tax savings,
$4,500 for a family of four making $60,000 a year. And for the millions of other
Americans who have no health insurance at all, this deduction would help put a
basic private health insurance plan within their reach. Changing the Tax Code is
a vital and necessary step to making health care affordable for more Americans.

My second proposal is to help the States that are coming up with innovative ways
to cover the uninsured. States that make basic private health insurance
available to all their citizens should receive Federal funds to help them
provide this coverage to the poor and the sick. I have asked the Secretary of
Health and Human Services to work with Congress to take existing Federal funds
and use them to create "Affordable Choices" grants. These grants would give our
Nation's Governors more money and more flexibility to get private health
insurance to those most in need.

There are many other ways that Congress can help. We need to expand health
savings accounts. We need to help small businesses through association health
plans, we need to reduce costs and medical errors with better information
technology. We will encourage price transparency, and to protect good doctors
from junk lawsuits we need to pass medical liability reform. And in all we do,
we must remember that the best health care decisions are made not by government
and insurance companies, but by patients and their doctors.

Extending hope and opportunity in our country requires an immigration system
worthy of America, with laws that are fair and borders that are secure. When
laws and borders are routinely violated, this harms the interests of our
country. To secure our border, we are doubling the size of the Border Patrol,
and funding new infrastructure and technology.

Yet even with all these steps, we cannot fully secure the border unless we take
pressure off the border, and that requires a temporary worker program. We should
establish a legal and orderly path for foreign workers to enter our country to
work on a temporary basis. As a result, they won't have to try to sneak in, and
that will leave border agents free to chase down drug smugglers and criminals
and terrorists. We will enforce our immigration laws at the work site, and give
employers the tools to verify the legal status of their workers, so there is no
excuse left for violating the law. We need to uphold the great tradition of the
melting pot that welcomes and assimilates new arrivals. We need to resolve the
status of illegal immigrants who are already in our country, without animosity
and without amnesty.

Convictions run deep in this Capitol when it comes to immigration. Let us have a
serious, civil, and conclusive debate, so that you can pass, and I can sign,
comprehensive immigration reform into law.

Extending hope and opportunity depends on a stable supply of energy that keeps
America's economy running and America's environment clean. For too long our
Nation has been dependent on foreign oil, and this dependence leaves us more
vulnerable to hostile regimes, and to terrorists, who could cause huge
disruptions of oil shipments, and raise the price of oil, and do great harm to
our economy.

It is in our vital interest to diversify America's energy supply, and the way
forward is through technology. We must continue changing the way America
generates electric power, by even greater use of clean coal technology, solar
and wind energy, and clean, safe nuclear power. We need to press on with battery
research for plug-in and hybrid vehicles and expand the use of clean diesel
vehicles and biodiesel fuel. We must continue investing in new methods of
producing ethanol, using everything from wood chips, to grasses, to agricultural
wastes.

We have made a lot of progress, thanks to good policies here in Washington and
the strong response of the market. And now even more dramatic advances are
within reach. Tonight, I ask Congress to join me in pursuing a great goal. Let
us build on the work we have done and reduce gasoline usage in the United States
by 20 percent in the next 10 years. When we do that, we will be cutting our
total imports by the equivalent of three-quarters of all the oil we now import
from the Middle East.

To reach this goal, we must increase the supply of alternative fuels, by setting
a mandatory fuels standard to require 35 billion gallons of renewable and
alternative fuels in 2017. And that is nearly five times the current target. At
the same time, we need to reform and modernize fuel economy standards for cars
the way we did for light trucks, and conserve up to 8\1/2\ billion more gallons
of gasoline by 2017.

Achieving these ambitious goals will dramatically reduce our dependence on
foreign oil, but it is not going to eliminate it. So as we continue to diversify
our fuel supply, we must also step up domestic oil production in environmentally
sensitive ways. And to further protect America against severe disruptions to our
oil supply, I ask Congress to double the current capacity of the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve.

America is on the verge of technological breakthroughs that will enable us to
live our lives less dependent on oil. These technologies will help us become
better stewards of the environment, and they will help us to confront the
serious challenge of global climate change.

A future of hope and opportunity requires a fair, impartial system of justice.
The lives of our citizens across our Nation are affected by the outcome of cases
pending in our Federal courts. We have a shared obligation to ensure that the
Federal courts have enough judges to hear those cases and deliver timely
rulings. As president, I have a duty to nominate qualified men and women to
vacancies on the Federal bench. And the United States Senate has a duty as well,
to give those nominees a fair hearing and a prompt up-or-down vote on the Senate
floor.

For all of us in this room, there is no higher responsibility than to protect
the people of this country from danger. Five years have come and gone since we
saw the scenes and felt the sorrow that the terrorists can cause. We have had
time to take stock of our situation. We have added many critical protections to
guard the homeland. We know with certainty that the horrors of that September
morning were just a glimpse of what the terrorists intend for us, unless we stop
them.

With the distance of time, we find ourselves debating the causes of conflict and
the course we have followed. Such debates are essential when a great democracy
faces great questions. Yet one question has surely been settled, that to win the
war on terror we must take the fight to the enemy.

From the start, America and our allies have protected our people by staying on
the offense. The enemy knows that the days of comfortable sanctuary, easy
movement, steady financing, and free-flowing communications are long over. For
the terrorists, life since 9/11 has never been the same.

Our success in this war is often measured by the things that did not happen. We
cannot know the full extent of the attacks that we and our allies have prevents,
but here is some of what we do know: we stopped an al Qaeda plot to fly a
hijacked airplane into the tallest building on the west coast. We broke up a
Southeast Asian terrorist cell grooming operatives for attacks inside the United
States. We uncovered an al Qaeda cell developing anthrax to be used in attacks
against America. And just last August, British authorities uncovered a plot to
blow up passenger planes bound for America over the Atlantic Ocean. For each
life saved, we owe a debt of gratitude to the brave public servants who devote
their lives to finding the terrorists and stopping them.

Every success against the terrorists is a reminder of the shoreless ambitions of
this enemy. The evil that inspired and rejoiced in 9/11 is still at work in the
world. And so long as that is the case, America is still a Nation at war.

In the minds of the terrorists, this war began well before September 11 and will
not end until their radical vision is fulfilled. And these past 5 years have
given us a much clearer view of the nature of this enemy. Al Qaeda and its
followers are Sunni extremists, possessed by hatred and commanded by a harsh and
narrow ideology. Take almost any principle of civilization, and their goal is
the opposite. They preach with threats, instruct with bullets and bombs, and
promise paradise for the murder of the innocent.

Our enemies are quite explicit about their intentions. They want to overthrow
moderate governments and establish safe havens from which to plan and carry out
new attacks on our country. By killing and terrorizing Americans, they want to
force our country to retreat from the world and abandon the cause of liberty.
They would then be free to impose their will and spread their totalitarian
ideology. Listen to this warning from the late terrorist Zarqawi: "We will
sacrifice our blood and bodies to put an end to your dreams, and what is coming
is even worse." And Osama bin Laden declared: "Death is better than living on
this Earth with the unbelievers among us."

These men are not given to idle words, and they are just one camp in the
Islamist radical movement. In recent times, it has also become clear that we
face an escalating danger from Shia extremists who are just as hostile to
America and are also determined to dominate the Middle East. Many are known to
take direction from the regime in Iran, which is funding and arming terrorists
like Hezbollah, a group second only to al Qaeda in the American lives it has
taken.

The Shia and Sunni extremists are different faces of the same totalitarian
threat. Whatever slogans they chant, when they slaughter the innocent, they have
the same wicked purposes. They want to kill Americans, kill democracy in the
Middle East, and gain the weapons to kill on an even more horrific scale.

In the sixth year since our Nation was attacked, I wish I could report to you
that the dangers had ended. They have not. And so it remains the policy of this
government to use every lawful and proper tool of intelligence, diplomacy, law
enforcement, and military action to do our duty, to find these enemies, and to
protect the American people.

This war is more than a clash of arms. It is a decisive ideological struggle,
and the security of our Nation is in the balance. To prevail, we must remove the
conditions that inspire blind hatred, and drove 19 men to get onto airplanes and
to come and kill us. What every terrorist fears most is human freedom, societies
where men and women make their own choices, answer to their own conscience, and
live by their hopes instead of their resentments. Free people are not drawn to
violent and malignant ideologies, and most will choose a better way when they
are given a chance. So we advance our own security interests by helping
moderates, reformers, and brave voices for democracy. The great question of our
day is whether America will help men and women in the Middle East to build free
societies and share in the rights of all humanity. And I say, for the sake of
our own security, we must.

In the last 2 years, we have seen the desire for liberty in the broader Middle
East, and we have been sobered by the enemy's fierce reaction. In 2005, the
world watched as the citizens of Lebanon raised the banner of the Cedar
Revolution. They drove out the Syrian occupiers, and chose new leaders in free
elections. In 2005, the people of Afghanistan defied the terrorists and elected
a democratic legislature. And in 2005, the Iraqi people held three national
elections, choosing a transitional government, adopting the most progressive,
democratic constitution in the Arab world, and then electing a government under
that constitution. Despite endless threats from the killers in their midst,
nearly 12 million Iraqi citizens came out to vote in a show of hope and
solidarity we should never forget.

A thinking enemy watched all of these scenes, adjusted their tactics, and in
2006 they struck back. In Lebanon, assassins took the life of Pierre Gemayel, a
prominent participant in the Cedar Revolution. Hezbollah terrorists, with
support from Syria and Iran, sowed conflict in the region and are seeking to
undermine Lebanon's legitimately elected government. In Afghanistan, Taliban and
al Qaeda fighters tried to regain power by regrouping and engaging Afghan and
NATO forces. In Iraq, al Qaeda and other Sunni extremists blew up one of the
most sacred places in Shia Islam, the Golden Mosque of Samarra. This atrocity,
directed at a Muslim house of prayer, was designed to provoke retaliation from
Iraqi Shia, and it succeeded. Radical Shia elements, some of whom receive
support from Iran, formed death squads. The result was a tragic escalation of
sectarian rage and reprisal that continues to this day.

This is not the fight we entered in Iraq, but it is the fight we are in. Every
one of us wishes that this war were over and won. Yet it would not be like us to
leave our promises unkept, our friends abandoned, and our own security at risk.
Ladies and gentlemen, on this day, at this hour, it is still within our power to
shape the outcome of this battle. Let us find our resolve and turn events toward
victory.

We are carrying out a new strategy in Iraq, a plan that demands more from Iraq's
elected government and gives our forces in Iraq the reinforcements they need to
complete their mission. Our goal is a democratic Iraq that upholds the rule of
law, respects the rights of its people, provides them security, and is an ally
in the war on terror.

In order to make progress toward this goal, the Iraqi Government must stop the
sectarian violence in its capital. But the Iraqis are not yet ready to do this
on their own. So we are deploying reinforcements of more than 20,000 additional
soldiers and marines to Iraq. The vast majority will go to Baghdad, where they
will help Iraqi forces to clear and secure neighborhoods, and serve as advisers
embedded in Iraqi Army units. With Iraqis in the lead, our forces will help
secure the city by chasing down the terrorists, insurgents, and the roaming
death squads. And in Anbar province, where al Qaeda terrorists have gathered and
local forces have begun showing a willingness to fight them, we are sending an
additional 4,000 United States marines, with orders to find the terrorists and
clear them out. We did not drive al Qaeda out of their safe haven in Afghanistan
only to let them set up a new safe haven in a free Iraq.

The people of Iraq want to live in peace, and now is the time for their
government to act. Iraq's leaders know that our commitment is not open ended.
They have promised to deploy more of their own troops to secure Baghdad, and
they must do so. They have pledged that they will confront violent radicals of
any faction or political party. And they need to follow through and lift
needless restrictions on Iraqi and Coalition forces so these troops can achieve
their mission of bringing security to all of the people of Baghdad. Iraq's
leaders have committed themselves to a series of benchmarks to achieve
reconciliation, to share oil revenues among all of Iraq's citizens, to put the
wealth of Iraq into the rebuilding of Iraq, to allow more Iraqis to reenter
their nation's civic life, to hold local elections, and to take responsibility
for security in every Iraqi province. But for all of this to happen, Baghdad
must be secured. And our plan will help the Iraqi Government take back its
capital and make good on its commitments.

My fellow citizens, our military commanders and I have carefully weighed the
options. We discussed every possible approach. In the end, I chose this course
of action because it provides the best chance for success. Many in this Chamber
understand that America must not fail in Iraq, because you understand that the
consequences of failure would be grievous and far reaching.

If American forces step back before Baghdad is secure, the Iraqi Government
would be overrun by extremists on all sides. We could expect an epic battle
between Shia extremists backed by Iran, and Sunni extremists aided by al Qaeda
and supporters of the old regime. A contagion of violence could spill out across
the country, and in time the entire region could be drawn into the conflict.

For America, this is a nightmare scenario. For the enemy, this is the objective.
Chaos is their greatest ally in this struggle. And out of chaos in Iraq would
emerge an emboldened enemy with new safe havens, new recruits, new resources,
and an even greater determination to harm America. To allow this to happen would
be to ignore the lessons of September 11 and invite tragedy. And ladies and
gentlemen, nothing is more important at this moment in our history than for
America to succeed in the Middle East, to succeed in Iraq, and to spare the
American people from this danger.

This is where matters stand tonight, in the here and now. I have spoken with
many of you in person. I respect you and the arguments you have made. We went
into this largely united, in our assumptions and in our convictions. And
whatever you voted for, you did not vote for failure. Our country is pursuing a
new strategy in Iraq, and I ask you to give it a chance to work. And I ask you
to support our troops in the field, and those on their way.

The war on terror we fight today is a generational struggle that will continue
long after you and I have turned our duties over to others. That is why it is
important to work together so our Nation can see this great effort through. Both
parties and both branches should work in close consultation. And this is why I
propose to establish a special advisory council on the war on terror, made up of
leaders in Congress from both political parties. We will share ideas for how to
position America to meet every challenge that confronts us. And we will show our
enemies abroad that we are united in the goal of victory.

One of the first steps we can take together is to add to the ranks of our
military, so that the American Armed Forces are ready for all the challenges
ahead. Tonight I ask the Congress to authorize an increase in the size of our
active Army and Marine Corps by 92,000 in the next 5 years. A second task we can
take on together is to design and establish a volunteer civilian reserve corps.
Such a corps would function much like our military reserve. It would ease the
burden on the Armed Forces by allowing us to hire civilians with critical skills
to serve on missions abroad when America needs them. And it would give people
across America who do not wear the uniform a chance to serve in the defining
struggle of our time.

Americans can have confidence in the outcome of this struggle, because we are
not in this struggle alone. We have a diplomatic strategy that is rallying the
world to join in the fight against extremism. In Iraq, multinational forces are
operating under a mandate from the United Nations, and we are working with
Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the gulf states to increase support for Iraq's
government. The United Nations has imposed sanctions on Iran and made it clear
that the world will not allow the regime in Tehran to acquire nuclear weapons.
With the other members of the Quartet, the U.N., the European Union and Russia,
we are pursuing diplomacy to help bring peace to the Holy Land, and pursuing the
establishment of a democratic Palestinian state living side by side with Israel
in peace and security. In Afghanistan, NATO has taken the lead in turning back
the Taliban and al Qaeda offensive, the first time the alliance has deployed
forces outside the North Atlantic area. Together with our partners in China,
Japan, Russia, and South Korea, we are pursuing intensive diplomacy to achieve a
Korean Peninsula free of nuclear weapons. And we will continue to speak out for
the cause of freedom in places like Cuba, Belarus, and Burma, and continue to
awaken the conscience of the world to save the people of Darfur.

American foreign policy is more than a matter of war and diplomacy. Our work in
the world is also based on a timeless truth: to whom much is given, much is
required. We hear the call to take on the challenges of hunger and poverty and
disease, and that is precisely what America is doing. We must continue to fight
HIV/AIDS, especially on the continent of Africa. Because you funded our
Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the number of people receiving life-saving drugs
has grown from 50,000 to more than 800,000 in 3 short years. I ask you to
continue funding our efforts to fight HIV/AIDS, and I ask you to provide $1.2
billion over 5 years so we can combat malaria in 15 African countries. I ask
that you fund the Millennium Challenge Account so that American aid reaches the
people who need it, in nations where democracy is on the rise and corruption is
in retreat. And let us continue to support the expanded trade and debt relief
that are the best hope for lifting lives and eliminating poverty.

When America serves others in this way, we show the strength and generosity of
our country. These deeds reflect the character of our people. The greatest
strength we have is the heroic kindness, courage, and self-sacrifice of the
American people. You see this spirit often if you know where to look, and
tonight we need only look above to the gallery.

Dikembe Mutombo grew up in Africa amid great poverty and disease. He came to
Georgetown University on a scholarship to study medicine, but Coach John
Thompson got a look at Dikembe and had a different idea. Dikembe became a star
in the NBA and a citizen of the United States. But he never forgot the land of
his birth, or the duty to share his blessings with others. He built a brand-new
hospital in his old hometown. A friend has said of this good hearted man:
"Mutombo believes that God has given him this opportunity to do great things."
And we are proud to call this son of the Congo a citizen of the United States of
America.


After her daughter was born, Julie Aigner-Clark searched for ways to share her
love of music and art with her child. So she borrowed some equipment and began
filming children's videos in her basement. The Baby Einstein Company was born,
and in just 5 years her business grew to more than $20 million in sales. In
November 2001, Julie sold Baby Einstein to Walt Disney Company; and with her
help, Baby Einstein has grown into a $200 million business. Julie represents the
great enterprising spirit of America. And she is using her success to help
others, producing child safety videos with John Walsh of the National Center for
Missing and Exploited Children. Julie says of her new project: "I believe it is
the most important thing that I have ever done. I believe that children have the
right to live in a world that is safe." And so tonight we are pleased to welcome
this talented business entrepreneur and generous social entrepreneur, Julie
Aigner-Clark.

Three weeks ago, Wesley Autry was waiting at a Harlem subway station with his
two little girls, when he saw a man fall into the path of a train. With seconds
to act, Wesley jumped onto the tracks, pulled the man into the space between the
rails, and held him as the train passed right above their heads. He insists he
is not a hero. He says: "We got guys and girls overseas dying for us to have our
freedoms. We have got to show each other some love." There is something
wonderful about a country that produces a brave and humble man like Wesley
Autry.

Tommy Rieman was a teenager pumping gas in Independence, Kentucky, when he
enlisted in the United States Army. In December 2003, he was on a reconnaissance
mission in Iraq when his team came under heavy enemy fire. From his Humvee,
Sergeant Rieman returned fire. He used his body as a shield to protect his
gunner. He was shot in the chest and arm, and received shrapnel wounds to his
legs, yet he refused medical attention and stayed in the fight. He helped to
repel a second attack, firing grenades at the enemy's position. For his
exceptional courage, Sergeant Rieman was awarded the Silver Star. And like so
many other Americans who have volunteered to defend us, he has earned the
respect and the gratitude of our whole country.

In such courage and compassion, ladies and gentlemen, we see the spirit and
character of America, and these qualities are not in short supply. This is a
decent and honorable country, and resilient, too. We have been through a lot
together. We have met challenges and faced dangers, and we know that more lie
ahead. Yet we can go forward with confidence, because the state of our Union is
strong, our cause in the world is right, and tonight that cause goes on. God
bless. Thank you for your prayers. Thank you.

[Applause, the Members rising.]

2008:
Madam Speaker, Vice President Cheney, Members of Congress, distinguished
guests, and fellow citizens:

Seven years have passed since I first stood before you at this rostrum. In
that time, our country has been tested in ways none of us could have imagined.
We have faced hard decisions about peace and war, rising competition in the
world economy, and the health and welfare of our citizens. These issues call
for vigorous debate, and I think its fair to say weve answered that call. Yet
history will record that amid our differences, we acted with purpose. And
together, we showed the world the power and resilience of American
self-government.

All of us were sent to Washington to carry out the peoples business. That is
the purpose of this body. It is the meaning of our oath. And it remains our
charge to keep.

The actions of the 110th Congress will affect the security and prosperity of
our nation long after this session has ended. In this election year, let us
show our fellow Americans that we recognize our responsibilities and are
determined to meet them. And let us show them that Republicans and Democrats
can compete for votes and cooperate for results at the same time.

From expanding opportunity to protecting our country, we have made good
progress. Yet we have unfinished business before us, and the American people
expect us to get it done.

In the work ahead, we must be guided by the philosophy that made our nation
great. As Americans, we believe in the power of individuals to determine their
destiny and shape the course of history. We believe that the most reliable
guide for our country is the collective wisdom of ordinary citizens. So in all
we do, we must trust in the ability of free people to make wise decisions, and
empower them to improve their lives and their futures.

To build a prosperous future, we must trust people with their own money and
empower them to grow our economy. As we meet tonight, our economy is
undergoing a period of uncertainty. America has added jobs for a record 52
straight months, but jobs are now growing at a slower pace. Wages are up, but
so are prices for food and gas. Exports are rising, but the housing market has
declined. And at kitchen tables across our country, there is concern about our
economic future.

In the long run, Americans can be confident about our economic growth. But in
the short run, we can all see that growth is slowing. So last week, my
administration reached agreement with Speaker Pelosi and Republican Leader
Boehner on a robust growth package that includes tax relief for individuals
and families and incentives for business investment. The temptation will be to
load up the bill. That would delay it or derail it, and neither option is
acceptable. This is a good agreement that will keep our economy growing and
our people working. And this Congress must pass it as soon as possible.

We have other work to do on taxes. Unless the Congress acts, most of the tax
relief we have delivered over the past seven years will be taken away. Some in
Washington argue that letting tax relief expire is not a tax increase. Try
explaining that to 116 million American taxpayers who would see their taxes
rise by an average of $1,800. Others have said they would personally be happy
to pay higher taxes. I welcome their enthusiasm, and I am pleased to report
that the I.R.S. accepts both checks and money orders.

Most Americans think their taxes are high enough. With all the other pressures
on their finances, American families should not have to worry about the
federal government taking a bigger bite out of their paychecks. There is only
one way to eliminate this uncertainty: make the tax relief permanent. And
members of Congress should know: If any bill raising taxes reaches my desk, I
will veto it.

Just as we trust Americans with their own money, we need to earn their trust
by spending their tax dollars wisely. Next week, I will send you a budget that
terminates or substantially reduces 151 wasteful or bloated programs totaling
more than $18 billion. And this budget will keep America on track for a
surplus in 2012. American families have to balance their budgets, and so
should their government.

The peoples trust in their government is undermined by Congressional earmarks 
special interest projects that are often snuck in at the last minute, without
discussion or debate. Last year, I asked you to voluntarily cut the number and
cost of earmarks in half. I also asked you to stop slipping earmarks into
committee reports that never even come to a vote. Unfortunately, neither goal
was met. So this time, if you send me an appropriations bill that does not cut
the number and cost of earmarks in half, I will send it back to you with my
veto. And tomorrow, I will issue an Executive Order that directs federal
agencies to ignore any future earmark that is not voted on by the Congress. If
these items are truly worth funding, the Congress should debate them in the
open and hold a public vote.

Our shared responsibilities extend beyond matters of taxes and spending.

On housing, we must trust Americans with the responsibility of homeownership
and empower them to weather turbulent times in the housing market. My
administration brought together the HOPE NOW alliance, which is helping many
struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure. The Congress can help even more.
Tonight I ask you to pass legislation to reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,
modernize the Federal Housing Administration, and allow state housing agencies
to issue tax-free bonds to help homeowners refinance their mortgages. These
are difficult times for many American families, and by taking these steps, we
can help more of them keep their homes.

To build a future of quality health care, we must trust patients and doctors
to make medical decisions and empower them with better information and better
options. We share a common goal: making health care more affordable and
accessible for all Americans. The best way to achieve that goal is by
expanding consumer choice, not government control. So I have proposed ending
the bias in the tax code against those who do not get their health insurance
through their employer. This one reform would put private coverage within
reach for millions, and I call on the Congress to pass it this year. The
Congress must also expand health savings accounts, create Association Health
Plans for small businesses, promote health information technology, and
confront the epidemic of junk medical lawsuits. With all these steps, we will
help ensure that decisions about your medical care are made in the privacy of
your doctors office  not in the halls of Congress.

On education, we must trust students to learn if given the chance and empower
parents to demand results from our schools. In neighborhoods across our
country, there are boys and girls with dreams  and a decent education is their
only hope of achieving them. Six years ago, we came together to pass the No
Child Left Behind Act, and today no one can deny its results. Last year,
fourth and eighth graders achieved the highest math scores on record. Reading
scores are on the rise. And African-American and Hispanic students posted
all-time highs. Now we must work together to increase accountability, add
flexibility for states and districts, reduce the number of high school
dropouts, and provide extra help for struggling schools. Members of Congress:
The No Child Left Behind Act is a bipartisan achievement. It is succeeding.
And we owe it to Americas children, their parents, and their teachers to
strengthen this good law.

We must also do more to help children when their schools do not measure up.
Thanks to the D.C. Opportunity Scholarships you approved, more than 2,600 of
the poorest children in our nations capital have found new hope at a
faith-based or other non-public school. Sadly, these schools are disappearing
at an alarming rate in many of Americas inner cities. So I will convene a
White House summit aimed at strengthening these lifelines of learning. And to
open the doors of these schools to more children, I ask you to support a new
$300 million program called Pell Grants for Kids. We have seen how Pell Grants
help low-income college students realize their full potential. Together, we
have expanded the size and reach of these grants. Now lets apply that same
spirit to help liberate poor children trapped in failing public schools.

On trade, we must trust American workers to compete with anyone in the world
and empower them by opening up new markets overseas. Today, our economic
growth increasingly depends on our ability to sell American goods, crops, and
services all over the world. So we are working to break down barriers to trade
and investment wherever we can. We are working for a successful Doha round of
trade talks, and we must complete a good agreement this year. At the same
time, we are pursuing opportunities to open up new markets by passing free
trade agreements.

I thank the Congress for approving a good agreement with Peru. Now I ask you
to approve agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. Many products
from these nations now enter America duty-free, yet many of our products face
steep tariffs in their markets. These agreements will level the playing field.
They will give us better access to nearly 100 million customers. And they will
support good jobs for the finest workers in the world: those whose products
say "Made in the USA."

These agreements also promote Americas strategic interests. The first
agreement that will come before you is with Colombia, a friend of America that
is confronting violence and terror and fighting drug traffickers. If we fail
to pass this agreement, we will embolden the purveyors of false populism in
our hemisphere. So we must come together, pass this agreement, and show our
neighbors in the region that democracy leads to a better life.

Trade brings better jobs, better choices, and better prices. Yet for some
Americans, trade can mean losing a job, and the federal government has a
responsibility to help. I ask the Congress to reauthorize and reform trade
adjustment assistance, so we can help these displaced workers learn new skills
and find new jobs.

To build a future of energy security, we must trust in the creative genius of
American researchers and entrepreneurs and empower them to pioneer a new
generation of clean energy technology. Our security, our prosperity, and our
environment all require reducing our dependence on oil. Last year, I asked you
to pass legislation to reduce oil consumption over the next decade, and you
responded. Together we should take the next steps: Let us fund new
technologies that can generate coal power while capturing carbon emissions.
Let us increase the use of renewable power and emissions-free nuclear power.
Let us continue investing in advanced battery technology and renewable fuels
to power the cars and trucks of the future. Let us create a new international
clean technology fund, which will help developing nations like India and China
make greater use of clean energy sources. And let us complete an international
agreement that has the potential to slow, stop, and eventually reverse the
growth of greenhouse gases. This agreement will be effective only if it
includes commitments by every major economy and gives none a free ride. The
United States is committed to strengthening our energy security and
confronting global climate change. And the best way to meet these goals is for
America to continue leading the way toward the development of cleaner and more
efficient technology.

To keep America competitive into the future, we must trust in the skill of our
scientists and engineers and empower them to pursue the breakthroughs of
tomorrow. Last year, the Congress passed legislation supporting the American
Competitiveness Initiative, but never followed through with the funding. This
funding is essential to keeping our scientific edge. So I ask the Congress to
double federal support for critical basic research in the physical sciences
and ensure America remains the most dynamic nation on earth.

On matters of science and life, we must trust in the innovative spirit of
medical researchers and empower them to discover new treatments while
respecting moral boundaries. In November, we witnessed a landmark achievement
when scientists discovered a way to reprogram adult skin cells to act like
embryonic stem cells. This breakthrough has the potential to move us beyond
the divisive debates of the past by extending the frontiers of medicine
without the destruction of human life. So we are expanding funding for this
type of ethical medical research. And as we explore promising avenues of
research, we must also ensure that all life is treated with the dignity it
deserves. So I call on the Congress to pass legislation that bans unethical
practices such as the buying, selling, patenting, or cloning of human life.

On matters of justice, we must trust in the wisdom of our Founders and empower
judges who understand that the Constitution means what it says. I have
submitted judicial nominees who will rule by the letter of the law, not the
whim of the gavel. Many of these nominees are being unfairly delayed. They are
worthy of confirmation, and the Senate should give each of them a prompt
up-or-down vote.

In communities across our land, we must trust in the good heart of the
American people and empower them to serve their neighbors in need. Over the
past seven years, more of our fellow citizens have discovered that the pursuit
of happiness leads to the path of service. Americans have volunteered in
record numbers. Charitable donations are higher than ever. Faith-based groups
are bringing hope to pockets of despair, with newfound support from the
federal government. And to help guarantee equal treatment for faith-based
organizations when they compete for federal funds, I ask you to permanently
extend Charitable Choice.

Tonight the armies of compassion continue the march to a new day in the Gulf
Coast. America honors the strength and resilience of the people of this
region. We reaffirm our pledge to help them build stronger and better than
before. And tonight I am pleased to announce that in April we will host this
years North American Summit of Canada, Mexico, and the United States in the
great city of New Orleans.

There are two other pressing challenges that I have raised repeatedly before
this body, and that this body has failed to address: entitlement spending and
immigration.

Every Member in this chamber knows that spending on entitlement programs like
Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid is growing faster than we can afford.
And we all know the painful choices ahead if America stays on this path:
massive tax increases, sudden and drastic cuts in benefits, or crippling
deficits. I have laid out proposals to reform these programs. Now I ask
members of Congress to offer your proposals and come up with a bipartisan
solution to save these vital programs for our children and grandchildren.

The other pressing challenge is immigration. America needs to secure our
borders  and with your help, my administration is taking steps to do so. We
are increasing work site enforcement, we are deploying fences and advanced
technologies to stop illegal crossings, we have effectively ended the policy
of "catch and release" at the border, and by the end of this year, we will
have doubled the number of border patrol agents. Yet we also need to
acknowledge that we will never fully secure our border until we create a
lawful way for foreign workers to come here and support our economy. This will
take pressure off the border and allow law enforcement to concentrate on those
who mean us harm. We must also find a sensible and humane way to deal with
people here illegally. Illegal immigration is complicated, but it can be
resolved. And it must be resolved in a way that upholds both our laws and our
highest ideals.

This is the business of our nation here at home. Yet building a prosperous
future for our citizens also depends on confronting enemies abroad and
advancing liberty in troubled regions of the world.

Our foreign policy is based on a clear premise: We trust that people, when
given the chance, will choose a future of freedom and peace. In the last seven
years, we have witnessed stirring moments in the history of liberty. We have
seen citizens in Georgia and Ukraine stand up for their right to free and fair
elections. We have seen people in Lebanon take to the streets to demand their
independence. We have seen Afghans emerge from the tyranny of the Taliban to
choose a new president and a new parliament. We have seen jubilant Iraqis
holding up ink-stained fingers and celebrating their freedom. And these images
of liberty have inspired us.

In the past seven years, we have also seen images that have sobered us. We
have watched throngs of mourners in Lebanon and Pakistan carrying the caskets
of beloved leaders taken by the assassins hand. We have seen wedding guests in
blood-soaked finery staggering from a hotel in Jordan, Afghans and Iraqis
blown up in mosques and markets, and trains in London and Madrid ripped apart
by bombs. And on a clear September day, we saw thousands of our fellow
citizens taken from us in an instant. These horrific images serve as a grim
reminder: The advance of liberty is opposed by terrorists and extremists  evil
men who despise freedom, despise America, and aim to subject millions to their
violent rule.

Since September 11, we have taken the fight to these terrorists and
extremists. We will stay on the offense, we will keep up the pressure, and we
will deliver justice to the enemies of America.

We are engaged in the defining ideological struggle of the 21st century. The
terrorists oppose every principle of humanity and decency that we hold dear.
Yet in this war on terror, there is one thing we and our enemies agree on: In
the long run, men and women who are free to determine their own destinies will
reject terror and refuse to live in tyranny. That is why the terrorists are
fighting to deny this choice to people in Lebanon,

Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the Palestinian Territories. And that is why,
for the security of America and the peace of the world, we are spreading the
hope of freedom.

In Afghanistan, America, our 25 NATO allies, and 15 partner nations are
helping the Afghan people defend their freedom and rebuild their country.
Thanks to the courage of these military and civilian personnel, a nation that
was once a safe haven for Al Qaeda is now a young democracy where boys and
girls are going to school, new roads and hospitals are being built, and people
are looking to the future with new hope. These successes must continue, so we
are adding 3,200 Marines to our forces in Afghanistan, where they will fight
the terrorists and train the Afghan Army and police. Defeating the Taliban and
Al Qaeda is critical to our security, and I thank the Congress for supporting
Americas vital mission in Afghanistan.

In Iraq, the terrorists and extremists are fighting to deny a proud people
their liberty and to establish safe havens for attacks across the world. One
year ago, our enemies were succeeding in their efforts to plunge Iraq into
chaos. So we reviewed our strategy and changed course. We launched a surge of
American forces into Iraq. And we gave our troops a new mission: Work with
Iraqi forces to protect the Iraqi people, pursue the enemy in its strongholds,
and deny the terrorists sanctuary anywhere in the country.

The Iraqi people quickly realized that something dramatic had happened. Those
who had worried that America was preparing to abandon them instead saw tens of
thousands of American forces flowing into their country. They saw our forces
moving into neighborhoods, clearing out the terrorists, and staying behind to
ensure the enemy did not return. And they saw our troops, along with
provincial reconstruction teams that include foreign service officers and
other skilled public servants, coming in to ensure that improved security was
followed by improvements in daily life. Our military and civilians in Iraq are
performing with courage and distinction, and they have the gratitude of our
whole nation.

The Iraqis launched a surge of their own. In the fall of 2006, Sunni tribal
leaders grew tired of Al Qaedas brutality and started a popular uprising
called "the Anbar Awakening." Over the past year, similar movements have
spread across the country. And today, this grass-roots surge includes more
than 80,000 Iraqi citizens who are fighting the terrorists. The government in
Baghdad has stepped forward as well  adding more than 100,000 new Iraqi
soldiers and police during the past year.

While the enemy is still dangerous and more work remains, the American and
Iraqi surges have achieved results few of us could have imagined just one year
ago:

When we met last year, many said containing the violence was impossible. A
year later, high profile terrorist attacks are down, civilian deaths are down,
and sectarian killings are down.

When we met last year, militia extremists  some armed and trained by Iran 
were wreaking havoc in large areas of Iraq. A year later, coalition and Iraqi
forces have killed or captured hundreds of militia fighters. And Iraqis of all
backgrounds increasingly realize that defeating these militia fighters is
critical to the future of their country.

When we met last year, Al Qaeda had sanctuaries in many areas of Iraq, and
their leaders had just offered American forces safe passage out of the
country. Today, it is Al Qaeda that is searching for safe passage. They have
been driven from many of the strongholds they once held, and over the past
year, we have captured or killed thousands of extremists in Iraq, including
hundreds of key Al Qaeda leaders and operatives. Last month, Osama bin Laden
released a tape in which he railed against Iraqi tribal leaders who have
turned on Al Qaeda and admitted that Coalition forces are growing stronger in
Iraq. Ladies and gentlemen, some may deny the surge is working, but among the
terrorists there is no doubt. Al Qaeda is on the run in Iraq, and this enemy
will be defeated.

When we met last year, our troop levels in Iraq were on the rise. Today,
because of the progress just described, we are implementing a policy of
"return on success," and the surge forces we sent to Iraq are beginning to
come home.

This progress is a credit to the valor of our troops and the brilliance of
their commanders. This evening, I want to speak directly to our men and women
on the front lines. Soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and coast guardsmen:
In the past year, you have done everything we have asked of you, and more. Our
nation is grateful for your courage. We are proud of your accomplishments. And
tonight in this hallowed chamber, with the American people as our witness, we
make you a solemn pledge: In the fight ahead, you will have all you need to
protect our nation. And I ask the Congress to meet its responsibilities to
these brave men and women by fully funding our troops.

Our enemies in Iraq have been hit hard. They are not yet defeated, and we can
still expect tough fighting ahead. Our objective in the coming year is to
sustain and build on the gains we made in 2007, while transitioning to the
next phase of our strategy. American troops are shifting from leading
operations, to partnering with Iraqi forces, and, eventually, to a protective
overwatch mission. As part of this transition, one Army brigade combat team
and one Marine Expeditionary Unit have already come home and will not be
replaced. In the coming months, four additional brigades and two Marine
battalions will follow suit. Taken together, this means more than 20,000 of
our troops are coming home.

Any further drawdown of U.S. troops will be based on conditions in Iraq and
the recommendations of our commanders. General Petraeus has warned that too
fast a drawdown could result in the "disintegration of the Iraqi Security
Forces, Al Qaeda-Iraq regaining lost ground, [and] a marked increase in
violence." Members of Congress: Having come so far and achieved so much, we
must not allow this to happen.

In the coming year, we will work with Iraqi leaders as they build on the
progress they are making toward political reconciliation. At the local level,
Sunnis, Shia and Kurds are beginning to come together to reclaim their
communities and rebuild their lives. Progress in the provinces must be matched
by progress in Baghdad. And we are seeing some encouraging signs. The national
government is sharing oil revenues with the provinces. The parliament recently
passed both a pension law and de-Baathification reform. Now they are debating
a provincial powers law. The Iraqis still have a distance to travel. But after
decades of dictatorship and the pain of sectarian violence, reconciliation is
taking place  and the Iraqi people are taking control of their future.

The mission in Iraq has been difficult and trying for our nation. But it is in
the vital interest of the United States that we succeed. A free Iraq will deny
Al Qaeda a safe haven. A free Iraq will show millions across the Middle East
that a future of liberty is possible. And a free Iraq will be a friend of
America, a partner in fighting terror, and a source of stability in a
dangerous part of the world.

By contrast, a failed Iraq would embolden extremists, strengthen Iran, and
give terrorists a base from which to launch new attacks on our friends, our
allies, and our homeland. The enemy has made its intentions clear. At a time
when the momentum seemed to favor them, Al Qaedas top commander in Iraq
declared that they will not rest until they have attacked us here in
Washington. My fellow Americans: We will not rest either. We will not rest
until this enemy has been defeated. We must do the difficult work today, so
that years from now people will look back and say that this generation rose to
the moment, prevailed in a tough fight, and left behind a more hopeful region
and a safer America.

We are also standing against the forces of extremism in the Holy Land, where
we have new cause for hope. Palestinians have elected a president who
recognizes that confronting terror is essential to achieving a state where his
people can live in dignity and at peace with Israel. Israelis have leaders who
recognize that a peaceful, democratic Palestinian state will be a source of
lasting security. This month in Ramallah and Jerusalem, I assured leaders from
both sides that America will do, and I will do, everything we can to help them
achieve a peace agreement that defines a Palestinian state by the end of this
year. The time has come for a Holy Land where a democratic Israel and a
democratic Palestine live side-by-side in peace.

We are also standing against the forces of extremism embodied by the regime in
Tehran. Irans rulers oppress a good and talented people. And wherever freedom
advances in the Middle East, it seems the Iranian regime is there to oppose
it. Iran is funding and training militia groups in Iraq, supporting Hezbollah
terrorists in Lebanon, and backing Hamas efforts to undermine peace in the
Holy Land. Tehran is also developing ballistic missiles of increasing range
and continues to develop its capability to enrich uranium, which could be used
to create a nuclear weapon. Our message to the people of Iran is clear: We
have no quarrel with you, we respect your traditions and your history, and we
look forward to the day when you have your freedom. Our message to the leaders
of Iran is also clear: Verifiably suspend your nuclear enrichment, so
negotiations can begin. And to rejoin the community of nations, come clean
about your nuclear intentions and past actions, stop your oppression at home,
and cease your support for terror abroad. But above all, know this: America
will confront those who threaten our troops, we will stand by our allies, and
we will defend our vital interests in the Persian Gulf.

On the home front, we will continue to take every lawful and effective measure
to protect our country. This is our most solemn duty. We are grateful that
there has not been another attack on our soil since September 11. This is not
for a lack of desire or effort on the part of the enemy. In the past six
years, we have stopped numerous attacks, including a plot to fly a plane into
the tallest building in Los Angeles and another to blow up passenger jets
bound for America over the Atlantic. Dedicated men and women in our government
toil day and night to stop the terrorists from carrying out their plans. These
good citizens are saving American lives, and everyone in this chamber owes
them our thanks. And we owe them something more: We owe them the tools they
need to keep our people safe.

One of the most important tools we can give them is the ability to monitor
terrorist communications. To protect America, we need to know who the
terrorists are talking to, what they are saying, and what they are planning.
Last year, the Congress passed legislation to help us do that. Unfortunately,
the Congress set the legislation to expire on February 1. This means that if
you do not act by Friday, our ability to track terrorist threats would be
weakened and our citizens will be in greater danger. The Congress must ensure
the flow of vital intelligence is not disrupted. The Congress must pass
liability protection for companies believed to have assisted in the efforts to
defend America. We have had ample time for debate. The time to act is now.

Protecting our nation from the dangers of a new century requires more than
good intelligence and a strong military. It also requires changing the
conditions that breed resentment and allow extremists to prey on despair. So
America is using its influence to build a freer, more hopeful, and more
compassionate world. This is a reflection of our national interest and the
calling of our conscience.

America is opposing genocide in Sudan and supporting freedom in countries from
Cuba and Zimbabwe to Belarus and Burma.

America is leading the fight against global poverty, with strong education
initiatives and humanitarian assistance. We have also changed the way we
deliver aid by launching the Millennium Challenge Account. This program
strengthens democracy, transparency, and the rule of law in developing
nations, and I ask you to fully fund this important initiative.

America is leading the fight against global hunger. Today, more than half the
worlds food aid comes from the United States. And tonight, I ask the Congress
to support an innovative proposal to provide food assistance by purchasing
crops directly from farmers in the developing world, so we can build up local
agriculture and help break the cycle of famine.

America is leading the fight against disease. With your help, we are working
to cut by half the number of malaria-related deaths in 15 African nations. And
our Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief is treating 1.4 million people. We can
bring healing and hope to many more. So I ask you to maintain the principles
that have changed behavior and made this program a success. And I call on you
to double our initial commitment to fighting HIV/AIDS by approving an
additional $30 billion over the next 5 years.

America is a force for hope in the world because we are a compassionate
people, and some of the most compassionate Americans are those who have
stepped forward to protect us. We must keep faith with all who have risked
life and limb so that we might live in freedom and peace. Over the past seven
years, we have increased funding for veterans by more than 95 percent. As we
increase funding, we must also reform our veterans system to meet the needs of
a new war and a new generation. I call on the Congress to enact the reforms
recommended by Senator Bob Dole and Secretary Donna Shalala, so we can improve
the system of care for our wounded warriors and help them build lives of hope,
promise, and dignity.

Our military families also sacrifice for America. They endure sleepless nights
and the daily struggle of providing for children while a loved one is serving
far from home. We have a responsibility to provide for them. So I ask you to
join me in expanding their access to child care, creating new hiring
preferences for military spouses across the federal government, and allowing
our troops to transfer their unused education benefits to their spouses or
children. Our military families serve our nation, they inspire our nation, and
tonight our nation honors them.

The secret of our strength, the miracle of America, is that our greatness lies
not in our government, but in the spirit and determination of our people. When
the Federal Convention met in Philadelphia in 1787, our nation was bound by
the Articles of Confederation, which began with the words, "We the undersigned
delegates." When Gouverneur Morris was asked to draft the preamble to our new
Constitution, he offered an important revision and opened with words that
changed the course of our nation and the history of the world: "We the
people."

By trusting the people, our Founders wagered that a great and noble nation
could be built on the liberty that resides in the hearts of all men and women.
By trusting the people, succeeding generations transformed our fragile young
democracy into the most powerful nation on earth and a beacon of hope for
millions. And so long as we continue to trust the people, our nation will
prosper, our liberty will be secure, and the State of our Union will remain
strong. So tonight, with confidence in freedoms power, and trust in the
people, let us set forth to do their business.
